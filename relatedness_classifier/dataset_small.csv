model;"Skype and Twitter are all banned in China.";"Skype and Twitter are all banned in China.";"The first part of this article explains what a VPN is and how it can be used to access Facebook, YouTube and the other websites that are currently blocked in China.  The second part is a comparative review of ExpressVPN, VyprVPN and PureVPN, which are in our opinion the three top VPN services for China. Well compare prices, functionality and the performance of the three VPNs.  Finally, we discuss what kind of websites are generally blocked in China.  As you probably already know, the internet doesnt work like we wish it did in China and a large number of websites are blocked by the Great Firewall. Among the websites that you cant access there are Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Google+.  There are many other blocked websites, and depending on what you do, it will be virtually impossible for you to work in China without a VPN (Virtual Private Network) from China. The most striking case is probably given by Google.com, which often returns an error message when used from within the Middle Kingdom.  In order to solve this problem, you can install a VPN, which masks your I.P. address so that your laptop appears to be connected from the U.S. or Japan even if you are in China.  A VPN will allow you to bypass the firewall and access any website you want. But you need to choose wisely: even if there are tens of VPN services available, only a few works well in China. We have tested several of them for years and today were going to review the three we like the most.  We recommend to install your VPN before you travel to China as, if you wait till you arrive in China, installing the VPN app in your smartphone will be more difficult as Google Play is blocked too!  In a nutshell, if you are looking for a VPN that has good performance, its easy to set up and has servers in many countries, we recommend you use ExpressVPN.  VyprVPN has similar performances, however has less servers.  The third option is PureVPN, which offers a reliable and cheap alternative to ExpressVPN and VyprVPN.  Even though there are several free options such as Freegate (which is actually a proxy, not a VPN), they arent at all reliable and are extremely slow. The practical result is that by resorting to a free option, you wont be able to do anything other than check your Facebook or Twitter feeds. Even posting a comment on Facebook will become an impossible mission. Forget about watching a YouTube video.  Recently, several free VPNs have been released that might offer decent performances. Our suggestion is to consider your decision carefully before installing one of them on your laptop or smartphone as, in many cases, theyll install other applications, such as programs that cause popup ads when you are surfing the internet, programs that store your browsing data to sell it to third parties or, in the worst cases, programs that use your computer as a server (with the result that both your laptop and internet connection will work much more slowly).  Since they only cost some Dollars per month, the best option is, without a doubt, to get a decent VPN service.  Nowadays, there is a large number of VPN services on the market. During the years weve spent in China, we tested many of them such as Witopia (which was really good back in 2010), Astrill (probably the most popular in 2011/2012), Webmaster and others.  Regardless of what the reviews that you find on the web say, many of them arent working anymore because the Great Firewall is being constantly updated and its becoming more difficult to bypass it every day. Many reviews you find are outdated or written by people that never went to China; therefore, check the publication date and if the website specializes on China, before you believe to the review!  Since 2013 until recently, weve been using StrongVPN and we must say that so far, we have never had many problems. However, during the last years many better VPNs appeared, when it comes down to use them from China.  As of January 2014, we started to also use VyprVPN, and rediscovered the pleasure of having internet on our cellphone. Since January 2015, due to the attack that multiple VPN providers suffered, we also began to use ExpressVPN as an alternative with features similar to those of VyprVPN. And also in this case, were very satisfied with the performances of the VPN. In October 2015 we started to use also PureVPN and so far its going well.  Money Back Guarantee: This is an important feature when choosing a VPN, most of all in China. Even though the three VPNs generally work well in China, every place is different. One VPN can work better than another in Shanghai but worse in Changsha, so it is important to have the opportunity to test the VPN before making a year commitment. With its 30 days of money back guarantee, ExpressVPN and VyprVPN offer the best guarantee.  Monthly Plan: If you are traveling to China for tourism or temporarily, a VPN for only one month is the best for you. In this case, since the prices are quite similar, we recommend ExpressVPN.  Annual Plan: Annual prices for different plans may vary greatly, but if we compare the prices of plans with similar performances between the three providers (ExpressVPN, VyprVPN Premium and PureVPN), their price are 8.32, 6.67 and 5.45 USD per month, respectively. Thus, PureVPN is the cheapest.  Support: When it comes down to use a VPN in China, its extremely important to have access to a support team that can help you when your configuration, for any reason, doesnt work anymore. According to our personal experience, the experience of our writers based in China and the feedback of our readers (both the ones that let comments at the end of our articles and the ones that contact us by email), so far ExpressVPN is the company that is providing the best, fastest support.  Server Count: This is a very important feature, as the more servers there are, the less likely it is that your connection will be slow or get cut out due to too many users using the same server. In this aspect, ExpressVPN is the one that offers the most guarantees.  Countries With Servers: This is a basic function, especially if you want to access content restricted to a specific country. In addition, it is also necessary to obtain a good browsing speed, as the closer you are to the server, the better the potential speed will be. Therefore, having a large number of servers in countries around China increases the possibility of finding one with good services. In this aspect, in appareance PureVPN beats the competition. However, if you care more about speed, then you shall consider the fact that ExpressVPN has much more servers in countries close to China.  Simultaneous Connections: Today, being able to have simultaneous connections is a basic feature of a VPN, as having a reliable and free connection to the internet is not just necessary for your laptop but also for your cell phone, tablet or other devices. Having simultaneous connections saves you from the problem of having to connect the VPN depending on which device you want to use to access the internet. With this, for example, you can check Google Maps on your cell phone while you check your Gmail on your computer. All the VPNs we recommend offer at least 3 simultaneous connections, which shall be more than enough.  Encryption Protocols: Encryption protocols are important to avoid censorship and to improve security. Having various possibilities will ensure that you have more weapons to avoid the Great Firewall, as some encryption protocols dont work at times. While in China, OpenVPN tends to work the best. VyprVPN Premium also offers a protocol exclusively designed to avoid blocking, called Chamaleon.  VPN Locations Switchings: This aspect is very important in China, as not all servers work well all the time, and changing servers is basic. In this aspect, there are no difference within the VPNs featured in this review.  We know this is a lot of info to digest and if you arent a tech expert, you might be a bit lost. In order to help you make the right choice, we suggest that you choose the best VPN depending on your priorities (speed, price, mobile devices performance, user-friendliness and security).  Still not sure what VPN should you choose?  Determining which VPN is the fastest is quite a complicated question, as it depends on a lot of factors (encryption protocol, Chinese city from which you are connecting, the website you want to visit, and the VPN server you connect to, among many other factors).  To respond to this question, over the past months, we have been testing from within China the connection speed of the three VPNs that we recommend. To do so, we have calculated the ping, download speed and upload speed (see below for a description of these parameters) while connected to different servers of these VPNs when accessing websites located in the USA, Europe and Hong Kong. While the results obtained are complicated to interpret due to the high number of parameters involved, we have been able to come to some conclusions:  While ExpressVPN seems to be the fastest, this may depend on the place in China from which you are connecting. If you want to verify the services of your VPN, below I give details on how to test it and interpret the results.  To calculate these values, you can go to webpages such as bandwidthplace.com, select one of the servers that is located near the websites that you normally visit (normally the United States) and calculate these values with and without the VPN activated.  With these results, you will be able to know if your VPN works well (the values will be similar to or even better than without the VPN). You will as well find out the quality of your connection in China (the values you obtain without a VPN).  Encryption protocols are an essential feature when it comes to choosing a VPN, as they determine its level of security and its ability to overcome the internet blocking in China and other countries. Below you can find the main encryption protocols:  Regarding China, currently, PTTP and SSTP dont tend to work, and the protocol which tends to be most effective when it comes to getting around the firewall is OpenVPN.  Before starting this section, we would like to inform you that these conclusions are not based on objective data; rather, they are based on our personal experience using VPNs in China.  VPNs work better outside of large cities: Despite not being able to find technical data to confirm our observations, it appears that the Great Firewall is much more effective in large cities such as Beijing or Shanghai. This makes it a lot more difficult for VPNs to connect, and also makes connections less stable. There are even VPNs that dont work in these two cities, but which do work in second or third-tier cities.  Poor internet connections limit VPN performance: While this point is obvious, we wanted to highlight it, because it seems to be typical to blame things on the quality of the VPN when it doesnt connect. Often, the problem is due to the fact that the connection quality is so bad that it prevents all VPNs from working normally. This situation is common on hotel WIFI networks (normally at hostels) or in cafs. The same goes for mobile data connections, as in large cities, they tend to be so saturated that they prevent VPNs from working properly.  Different VPNs dont always behave the same: Its common that depending on the place youre connecting from, some VPNs work better than others. For example ExpressVPN might work better from your workplace internet connection, whereas VyprVPN might work better from home. Nonetheless, as a general rule, ExpressVPN tends to have the least problems connecting, even on low-quality connections. As for VyprVPN, even though it tends to run into quite a few problems when on low-quality networks, if you have a relatively good connection and use the connect to the fastest server option, its services are normally very good, and at times even better than those of ExpressVPN. As for PureVPN, it doesnt usually work on low-quality connections.  We recommend you choose between ExpressVPN Annual Package, Premium Annual Package and PureVPN Annual Package as, in our opinion, these are the packages that offer the best quality to price ratio.  Its a common practice among VPN providers to renew your subscription automatically (included the three VPNs we recommend). This means that after one month (or one year), they will charge you for another month (or another year, according to the subscribtion you purchased).  How to avoid that?  ExpressVPN: ExpressVPN allows you to turn off the auto-renewal by logging in to your account.  VyprVPN: To avoid the recurring payment with VyprVPN you should cancel the subscription by accessing to the Control Panel. You should do it before the actual billing period ends.  PureVPN: The only way to avoid the auto-renewal with PureVPN is to sign in to your account and send a ticket asking to cancel it.  Note that if you subscribe using Paypal you can also disallow recurring payments directly from your Paypal account.  In the case you forgot to deactivate the auto renewal and the company already charged you for the next billing period, in many cases you can still ask the money back. ExpressVPN gives you 30 days to ask for a refund (however its not clear if it also applies to the auto-renewal), VyprVPN doesnt specify if you can get a refund and PureVPN gives you 7 days to cancel the payment.  Open ExpressVPN software and click on Run a Speed Test. Then, click Run Tests (the blue button on the top right-hand side) and wait until the test finishes (about 5 minutes). At this point, select the server that appears first in the list (the fastest). Its as simple as that!  Open VyprVPN software and click on the Location icon. Then click on Show servers > Chronometer > Ping test. At this point you should select the server that shows the smallest number (this represents the time necessary for the info to travel from your laptop to the server).  Open PureVPN software (dont use the beta version as in our experience it doesnt work properly) and insert your user name and password. Then go to the Settings tab and, in the Security section, select VPN Mode: Best of Both Worlds Mode and activate the IPv6 leak Protection.  At this point, go back to the Dashboard, select Protocol: Automatic > Purpose Country: Optimum Anonymity/Security, then click on Quick Connect, choose a country in the map (only if needed) and, finally, click on Connect Now.  If there is any problem connecting the VPN, go back to the Dashboard and try one by one the different protocols (normally the OpenVPN should work). If it still doesnt work, go back to the Settings tab and select VPN Mode: High Security Mode.  We arent lawyers and we are certainly not qualified to provide any legal advice. So what follows is just our personal opinion:  As far as we know, using a VPN in China isnt strictly illegal. Even if its true that VPN get often blocked, in another hand VPNs are a necessary tool to improve security at companies, and because of this, it would make little sense to declare all VPN to be illegal.  However, in January 2017 the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology declared that the VPN services in China will now need to obtain a government approval.  The new regulation seems to only refer to VPN providers that operate from within China. Its not clear yet how (and if) this will also affects VPN providers that operate from outside China (like the ones we recommend).  In any case, you should keep in mind that while using a VPN, what you are doing can be legal as well as illegal. For example, if someone uses a VPN (to avoid being identified) to scam people, its obvious that this activity is illegal and will therefore be prosecuted.  One last warning: When you use a VPN, its as if you were connecting from the country where the server is located (normally the United States). Because of that, intellectual property laws can be a lot stricter than what youre used to in China, where regulations are much more lax in this sense. Therefore, do so at your own risk.  The list of websites blocked in China is long and changes every day. Generally speaking, the most popular social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Flickr, etc), blogging platforms (WordPress.com, Blogspot, etc), Google services (Google.com, Gmail, Google+, Google Hangouts Google Docs, etc) and media websites that may be or have been critical towards China (The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg and LeMonde, just to provide some examples) are blocked.  Then, there are websites or softwares that arent blocked but are so slow that they become practically useless. The most common example is probably Skype, which works on and off (for calls, messages usually work fine).  Generally speaking, most of the websites that arent hosted in a Chinese server will be slow, when you try to connect from within China. This is especially true after 8 PM (Chinese time), as this corresponds to both American and European working times. This implies that the traffic in and out the Chinese network will be larger, and tends to saturate fairly often.  The best way to overcome this problem is, of course, to choose a VPN that is working well in China!  As weve mentioned before, evaluating which VPN is the best for China is complicated because it depends on many factors. A good VPN in one city or for a particular connection may have worse performance than in other circumstances. During times when internet restrictions are intensified (for example, party meetings, or at the beginning of Chinese New Year), some VPNs hold up better than others.  Thanks to our personal experience and the many comments from our readers, currently, we can say that normally ExpressVPN tends to be the one that offers the best speeds and which best holds up during times of restrictions.  As for VyprVPN, in the past, its website was blocked a few times, and some servers dont work at times (most of all, those closest to China). However, if you play with the protocols and servers a bit, normally, you can find a configuration that offers good services.  As for PureVPN, we have a lot less experience using it and while during normal times, its services are good, during times when restrictions are intensified, it seems like it has the most problems.  Another VPN that is quite popular in China, Astrill, has been a target of the Great Firewall over the past years, and because of this, it often stops working. This is one of the reasons why we no longer recommend it.  With the increasingly widespread use of VPNs in the past years, VPN service providers are constantly innovating to improve their services. One of the most recent services that all VPN service providers are incorporating are VPN routers.  To put it simply, we can say that a VPN router is like connecting your VPN directly from the router in your house or office, and not from your computer or mobile device. This has a huge advantage, as you extend the VPN over the whole network and not just from specific devices, thus improving security and permitting all devices on the network to use the VPN (regardless of the number of simultaneous connections).  Depending on how the VPN on the router is configured, VPN routers are divided into three types.  Currently, ExpressVPN is offering the possibility of purchasing a physical VPN router (that is a router with a pre-installed VPN). You can also choose to configure your router manually. The routers compatible with ExpressVPN are the following: Asus, DD-WRT, D-Link, FlashRouters, Linksys, Netduma, Netgear, Sabai, Tomato, TP-LINK  Although VyprVPN does not offer routers with pre-installed software, it does offer an application so that you can install it on your router. To do you, before anything else, you are going to have to install the Tomato firmware on your router ( You can click here to see the list of compatible routers) and then the VyprVPN app.  Just like ExpressVPN, PureVPN also offers routers with pre-installed software which can also be configured manually. The compatible routers are the following: DDWRT, Netgear Genie, Asus, Belkin, Tomato, Linksys, TP-link, D-link, MikroTik, Sitecom Gigabit, Saba, TRENDnet  In China, a large number of websites are blocked, including Google, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Gmail, among others. Currently, VPNs (virtual private networks) are the most effective way to get around the blocking and to be able to browse the Internet without restrictions.  While VPNs are the most effective way of getting around restrictions on Internet use in China, currently, many of them dont work at all or work poorly. Many VPNs that offered good services in the past currently dont work, which means that it is important to have updated, first-hand information on which VPN service is currently offering the best services.  Just like other social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, or Instagram, Snapchat is blocked in China. Therefore, if you want to use Snapchat during your stay in China, you will have to have a VPN service to be able to use it.  Currently, Whatsapp works without problems in China. However, if you want to download the app in China, you will have problems downloading it if you dont have a VPN. Google Play and the iTunes Store tend to have quite a few problems.  The majority of Western social networks such as Instagram are blocked in China, which means that if you want to continue to post your photos on Instagram or see the updates of the people you are following, your only option is to use a VPN or similar service.  Since 2014, Viber, like many other similar services, is blocked in China. Therefore, your only option to access the services of Viber without restrictions during your stay in China is to acquire a service that allows you to get around blocking, such as the VPNs that we suggest in this article.  Currently, Skype continues to work in China, although often the quality of voice and video calls is quite poor, and these calls may be monitored by third parties. A VPN can help you to improve the quality of Skypes services and avoid being spied on.  Although iTunes and the App Store are not blocked in China, a large amount of their content is filtered and therefore not available. In addition, every once in a while, they stop working for a indefinite period of time, which is very annoying if you dont have a system to get around blocking.  Facetime can be used in China without problems. Even so, just like what happens with Skype over certain connections, its performance is far from optimal.  Yahoo search is not blocked in China, except for a few local versions such as Yahoo Hong Kong and Yahoo Taiwan. Still, the search results on Yahoo are filtered. Yahoo Mail can be accessed without problems.  Currently, Quora can be accessed without problems in China. Even so, given the type of website that Quora is, its possible that in the future it will be blocked. Also, its content doesnt appear to be filtered.  Yes. Currently, Dropbox cant be accessed in China without a VPN. If you have Dropbox installed on your computer, synchronization wont work either until you connect your VPN.  The reason for the blocking is probably a business reason, so that preference is given to local cloud storage systems.  For the time being, LinkedIn is not blocked in China and tends to work without too many problems. Nonetheless, keep in mind that websites hosted outside of China normally load slowly.  Due to legal problems, many VPN services dont offer servers in China. Out of the few VPNs that do offer servers in China, many are virtual and dont work, or if they do work, the speed doesnt let you browse the Chinanet normally. If youre interested in finding out which VPNs offer servers in China that work, you can read this article.  There are very few VPNs that work in China, and they are constantly blocked every time the Great Firewall of China is updated, which means that if you do find one, it will likely stop working soon. Plus, using free VPNs can be risky, as is explained in this article dedicated to analyzing free VPNs.";unrelated
model;"Skype and Twitter are all banned in China.";"Skype and Twitter are all banned in China.";"Following last weekends deadly riots in its western region of Xinjiang, Chinas central government has taken all the usual steps to block citizens from accessing foreign web services: aside from crippling Internet service in general, the authorities have blocked Twitter, removed unapproved references to the violence from search engines and has now apparently moved to bar its citizens from accessing Facebook from most parts of Mainland China just now. Two weeks ago, the government had already blocked just about every Google service, including communication tools like Gmail, Google Apps and Google Talk.  As of today 8pm Chinese time Facebook seems not to be accessible from most parts of China Mainland anymore. On the China Telecom connection of our Shanghai office the service vanished at around 7:45pm. Friends in Hong Kong are reporting that they can still access the website.  A quick test on WebsitePulse confirms the blocking of Twitter and YouTube (which have been restricted for a while) and now Facebook too, at least in some parts of the country.";fact
model;"Skype and Twitter are all banned in China.";"Skype and Twitter are all banned in China.";"More than half of the users of the most popular social medium in the world believe that Facebook does a sacred job of connecting people all around the world. Every once in a while, we hear a story of Facebook connecting long lost families and creating new friendships on different continents.   This would indeed be a great story if there was not for politics to meddle. Many a countries in the world have governments that lead pretty closed politics, which means that connecting with people around the world is not possible, thus Facebook cannot be accessed from those countries.  Well, the reasons are all really different and vary from country to country. One of the most popular reasons is to deny the right of the citizens to publicly express their opinions and their dissatisfaction with the government. This was an example in China, when Facebook and Twitter were blocked due to the fact that many Chinese protesters against government uploaded pictures of riots, which could have destabilized it.   Of course, China is not the only country which blocked Facebook, and we shall see a timeline of countries that blocked (even temporarily) or discussed blocking Facebook as well as the reason why they did it.  One of the first bigger incidents that happened was the creation of fake profile page of the Prime Minister of Mauritius. This resulted in one of the first known Facebook blockages in the world, and it lasted forwell  one day. The Information and Communication Technologies of Mauritius thus proved that they have an active control of the things happening in this country and its users on Facebook.  Syria was also very quick in banning Facebook and the excuse was the concern for the possible attacks that may be organized on the authorities. The ban was ended in 2011.  The second big incident happened in Morocco, when someone created a fake Facebook profile of Moroccan Prince. However, Facebook was not banned, but heavily controlled. Furthermore, websites such as YouTube, Skype and Google Earth have been banned and un banned periodically.  After the elections in Iran, Facebook was seen as a threat and the government thought that it is used for growing the opposition stronger. Therefore, in 2009, Facebook was officially banned from the country. It all lasted for 4 years, until something happened and Facebook and Twitter were suddenly available to all of the citizens. This was very strange, because there was no notice about it. Many people believe that it is some kind of a glitch that happened and allowed Facebook. However, restrictions regarding the internet in Iran are still very high.  China officially blocked Facebook in July 2009. Since then, Facebook was never activated again, although many people find different ways to access it. The reason for blocking it was a riot that happened in rmqi. Facebook was the main platform through which the protestors communicated and organized events.   Since then, there were many attempts to bring Facebook to China, especially due to the fact that Mark Zuckerberg is married to a Chinese. However, since then, China remains the main enemy to Facebook Empire, with its Great Firewall of China blocking the way.  Egypt also blocked Facebook for a few days during the riots that took place all over the country. Although Facebook is available now, the whole internet freedom is questionable in Egypt, as it is marked as partly free.  Although never officially blocked nor banned in Germany, Facebook was a discussion topic in Germanys government two times. The first time, the government just wanted to ban event creation on Facebook due to the fact that open events were (as a joke) attended by thousands of people, who actually attended the event in real life.   The second time Facebook was discussed was after the refugee crisis, when right wing nationalists started organizing events on Facebook and growing stronger. However, this issue still is not solved and we are yet to expect what German government will do on that matter.  Malaysian government also blocked Facebook for the couple of days, during the protests that happened in Egypt.  The blocking of Facebook never happened in UK, but many groups and pages were deleted by the government in the period of the royal wedding. These were mainly political activists who worried about the governments spending cuts.  Due to a difficult political and religious situation in Bangladesh, Facebook was banned for the first time in 2013, when many people, including an atheist blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider, lost their lives. The second time, Facebook was banned in 2015 and it has remained out of the reach of Bangladesh citizens since then.  Although North Korea issued an official statement in 2016 which bans this social medium, Facebook (and most of the Internet freedom, for that matter) was never actually allowed due to the very difficult political situation that exists in North Korea. The statement says that anyone who is caught using Facebook will be punished (whatever the punishment may be). Most of the citizens there have a very limited access to the internet, which is heavily controlled by the government.  Vietnam also blocked Facebook for 2 weeks, during the protest in Viettnam. Many protesters are said to have organized the event on Facebook.  A VPN service, such as LimeVPN will definitely help you overcome this ban anywhere in the world. VPN services are usually used not only for this, but for increasing overall security and anonymity on the internet. What you will get is the access to all of the banned and restricted websites in that country without the fear of being tracked or exposed to any of the surveillance systems.   All you need to do is to register for a VPN and choose the monthly plan that you want to use. After that, follow the instructions on how to set it up and you will be enjoying connecting with millions of people worldwide.   Is VPN illegal? No. All of the countries do not have laws regarding a VPN and you are free to use it as much as you want.  Facebook restriction does not only work on the country level but also on the level of institutions. Therefore, some of the schools and work places are being hit by a Facebook block. Officials believe that if Facebook is blocked, the students will focus on studying and the workers on working.   However, these kinds of blocks can also be overcome by using a Virtual Private Network, which was mentioned before.   To sum up, Facebooks goal is to connect all the people in the world, but they fail to do that because of the problems that may arise. Most of the problems were government-oriented and, as you saw above, most of the reasons why Facebook was blocked were due to governments and leaders feeling threatened by protestors. The Facebook blocking is currently critical in China and whether Mark Zuckerberg is going to succeed in his mission is still a mystery.

The ban was placed on the sites in 2009 following riots in the country and China's ruling Communist Party has restricted access ever since.     Yet, people living and working in a new free-trade zone in Shanghai - which covers just 17-square-miles - will be allowed to access these sites from Sunday, according to reports in the  Citing unidentified government sources, the Hong Kong newspaper also said authorities would welcome bids from foreign telecoms firms for licences to provide internet services in the zone.  China's Communist Party aggressively censors the internet, routinely deleting online postings and blocking access to websites it deems inappropriate or politically sensitive.  Facebook and Twitter were blocked by Beijing in mid-2009 following deadly riots in the western province of Xinjiang that authorities say were abetted by the social networking sites.     The New York Times has been blocked since reporting last year that the family of then-Premier Wen Jiabao had amassed a huge fortune.  The recently-approved Shanghai FTZ is said to be a 'test bed' for convertibility of China's yuan currency and further liberalisation of interest rates, as well as reforms of foreign direct investment and taxation, the State Council, or cabinet, has said.     The zone is set to formally launch on 29 September.    South China Morning Post quoted a government source as saying the idea of unblocking websites in the FTZ was to make foreigners 'feel like at home'.     'If they can't get onto Facebook or read The New York Times, they may naturally wonder how special the free-trade zone is compared with the rest of China,' the source added.  A spokesman for Facebook said the company had no comment on the newspaper report. No one at Twitter or the New York Times was immediately available to comment.  For Facebook, the world's largest online social network, with 1.15 billion users, China represents an important new market for growth.  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that making Facebook available in China is in keeping with his company's goal of connecting the world.  Earlier this month, Facebook CEO Sheryl Sandberg met with the head of China's State Council Information Office during a visit to Beijing.     The pair discussed Facebook's importance as Chinese enterprises continue to expand abroad 'and various cooperation matters around that,' according to a post on the Council's website.  Twitter, which is preparing for an initial public offering, could also benefit by being available in China, the world's largest Internet market by users.     Still, many Chinese Web users already use similar services, such as Sina Corp's Weibo.  China's three biggest telecoms companies - China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom - have been informed of the decision to allow foreign competition in the FTZ, the sources told the newspaper.  The three state-owned companies had not raised complaints because they knew the decision had been endorsed by Chinese leadership including Premier Li Keqiang, who has backed the Shanghai FTZ, the sources added.

model;"Skype and Twitter are all banned in China.";"Skype and Twitter are all banned in China.";"The headline was worthy of a double take, and the article read like a dispatch from a not-too-distant, perhaps dystopian future: Peoples Daily deputy editor in chief: Our number of Facebook fans second only to the New York Times. The famously red mouthpiece of Chinas Communist Party was claiming in a June 27 Chinese-language article that the popularity of its English-language Facebook page had overtaken those of the Wall Street Journal and USA Today. It quoted its own deputy editor in chief, Lu Xinning, telling a media forum in Russia that the paper had 4.6 million fans on Facebook, even though the social media platform is blocked in China. (The total is now 5.7 million.) The achievement, she said, showed how social media was upending the old pecking order, letting some papers overtake their rivals like cars on a winding road. But a closer look suggests the state-funded Dailys Facebook genuine fan base, which only surpassed 1,000 inApril 2013, is not as large as the numbers make it seem.  It may appear strange that the paper would boast of its popularity on an American website that Chinese are forbidden to visit. But its U.S. social media footprintis not for Chinese audiences. Run by the papers bureau in New York City, the Dailys Facebook page is essentially a form of advertising for its English-language service and for China itself. China is keen to project soft power through overseas Chinese-language learning centers known as Confucius Institutes but also via its media outlets, including the Peoples Daily, China Daily, and China Central Television. The Facebook page of the Peoples Daily offers a curated selection of news items that leans toward the odd and the international, much of it casting China in a positive light. Recent articles include a look at the favorite foods of foreign leaders (spoiler alert: U.S. President Barack Obama likes pizza), coverage of an underwater kissing contest in Shanghai, and photos of attractive young people participating in the Bubble Run, a sudsy 5K in the western city of Xian, which the paper claims (without citation) is regarded as the most fun 5K run in the world.  The Dailys English-language Facebook page has only recently exploded in popularity. On April 6, the page had around2,997,000 fans and was nearly neck and neck with USA Todays page, which had around2,953,000 fans, according to Socialbakers.com, a site that tracks Facebooks user data. But between April and the end of June, the Daily surged ahead. By July 5, it had almost doubled its fan base and was up to around5,743,000 fans, while USA Today was trailing with around3,159,000. Contrary to the deputy editor in chiefs claim that the page was second only to the New York Times, there are plenty of other media outlets with more fans on Facebook, including National Geographic and Playboy. But it is nonetheless true that the Daily has more Facebook fans than the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, and many other venerated global news outlets. The Socialbakers site shows the Daily ranked 25th on a list of global print media Facebook pages.  The sudden growth of the Dailys fan base and the geographic distribution of those fans raises questions about whether the paper looked to click farms, many of which are located in Southeast Asia, to help populate its millions of new fans. Click farms are businesses that sell social media likes, fans, and comments to help give clients the illusion of greater popularity. Click farms use fake computer generated Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram accounts, but also human employees with real accounts who like pages or become online fans.  Theres a fine line between garden-variety advertising and shadier practices. In July 2013, the U.S. State Department revealed after an internal audit that it had spent $630,000 on a campaign that some employees inside the agency considered equivalent to buying likes. Sometimes the distinction is obvious. A service helpfully called WeSellLikes.com advertises a package of 25,000 worldwide Facebook likes for just $599.99. Italian cybersecurity researchers Andrea Stroppa and Carlo De Micheli estimated in a 2013 report on click farms that the business of fake Facebook activity was worth about $200 million a year. Stroppa told Foreign Policy that the industry relies on English-speaking youth in countries like Indonesia, Pakistan, and India who spend their days online. They get some pennies to like Facebook pages and to comment on Instagram pictures, he said via Skype from Italy.  According to Socialbakers.com, more than 50 percent of the Dailys fans come from Pakistan, India, Indonesia, and Nepal. These are countries that Stroppa said are known click farm hubs. Indeed, Peoples Daily fan numbers in those countries have climbed sharply over the last few months, while pages of competing media sites like USA Today and the Wall Street Journal did not. Nepal is a revealing case. The Daily has around half a million fans in Nepal, according to Socialbakers, a number that represents about 9 percent of the papers total Facebook fan base. Thats a huge number for a country of 27 million where just over onethird of the population is online. Nepal added 307,671 new Daily fans between March 9 and June, Socialbakers shows, a relatively short span of time during which Nepal experienced its worst natural disaster in decades, the April 25 earthquake. During that same window of time, according to the same data, the New York Times added just 2,436 Nepalese fans, the Times of India just 3,224.  The New York office of the Peoples Daily Online referred questions about the pages sudden popularity to headquarters in Beijing; FP submitted an email query but did not receive a reply. Facebook did not respond to an email query about the Dailys Facebook page.  FP reached out to several Pakistani fans of the Dailys Facebook page. Umar Saeed, an engineering student in Multan, Pakistan, said via Facebook Messenger that he genuinely liked the Daily and its posts. They show the economical as well as structural progress of the great country, Saeed wrote. I like that page bcz i [sic] am from Pakistan and we love Chinese people here. (Pakistan has a strong relationship with China.) He said he has been on Facebook for five years and has never been paid to like a page. Another fan, Sohali Khan, made small talk via messenger but dodged questions about the Peoples Daily and click farms. Stroppa, the Italian researcher, said he has interacted with many people on social media that he suspected of being click farm employees, but that its hard to be certain. Theres no obvious difference between a genuinely active Facebook fan and someone who is getting paid to be one. The big picture, however, is a little easier to discern. Either China is the new master of journalism or what we are seeing is evidence of something not quite right, Stroppa said. He estimated that it would have cost the Daily between $20,000 and $100,000 to amass 3 million paid Facebook fans over the last few months.  For their part, Chinese readers are generally either incredulous or irritated that a standard bearer for Chinas tightly controlled media regime has been crowing about its global popularity on a website that censors have blocked domestically. One netizen on Weibo, Chinas social media platform, wrote sardonically in response, I would like to report the Peoples Daily for illegally scaling the Great Firewall. The Great Firewall refers to Chinas extensive use of website blocks and content filters to prevent Chinese from navigating to sites that the government considers too politically sensitive, pornographic, or defamatory. Another wrote, tongue in cheek, I would just like to know how the Peoples Daily got on Facebook. Does the government know? Perhaps fittingly, those comments were later censored.  Correction, July 7, 2015: The name of the Italian researcher is Carlo De Micheli. A previous version of this article mistakenly spelled his name Carla De Micheli.";unrelated

Beijing has announced it is lifting the ban on access to such websites, but only within one area of Shanghai  the new free-trade zone  the South China Morning Post reported.  Facebook and Twitter have been banned on mainland China since 2009, and now the Shanghai free-trade zone is set to be the first Hong Kong-like free trade area in mainland China.  The new zone, which the State Council in China approved in late August, will cover an expanse of 28.78 sq km in the Shanghais Pudong New Area.  The South China Morning Post today ran what it termed an exclusive, citing that sites such as the online portal of The New York Times, social networking site Facebook and microblogging site Twitter would all be accessible in this new Shanghai zone.  That paper also reported that government sources \"informed of the decision\" said \"on condition of anonymity\" that the first such zone on mainland China would also be open to bids from foreign telecommunications companies for licences to provide internet services within this new economic zone.  The newspaper claimed that mainland Chinas three biggest telecommunications companies  China Telecom, China Mobile, and China Unicom  incidentally, all State-owned enterprises  have already been told that foreign telcos will be given the opportunity to compete with them in order to win business in the Shanghai free-trade zone.  Up to now, Beijing, it would appear, has been keeping a tight rein over public access to online media channels.  According to the South China Morning Post, Beijing has up to now blocked access to several internet websites through the Great Firewall of China. This is the informal name for the Golden Shield project. In China, it is run by the Ministry of Public Security.";unrelated

China prefers local companies over foreign firms and often puts restrictions on foreign firms to protect homegrown talent. For example, there is a limit on the number of Hollywood movies that can be shown per year, so only the biggest names come to China and the domestic movie industry and grow. Same goes for the internet. China wants its domestic firms to develop and not get shouted out by multi-billion dollar Giants.  China likes to control the message and censor the media, some foreign companies play ball (Yahoo! and Microsoft) while others refuse (Google, Twitter, Wikipedia[1]). Google used to comply with Chinese censorship, then suddenly it withdrew and redirected all its search traffic to their Hong Kong site instead of the .cn site.  Another point to make is that Facebook et al. might not care that they are blocked. Google still does business in China. They have offices in Beijing and they sell advertising to Chinese firms. Likewise Facebook's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg is no stranger to China, he has even learned the Chinese language to an acceptably high level. He has discussed/made major deals with Chinese internet firms.  There are two ways to enter a foreign market. You can take your own brand into the country and try to eek out a bit of the market share over many years, or you can just buy into one of the existing players in that country and get instant market share. Even when Google was in China, it didn't have the success that has had elsewhere. Yahoo has been in China for a very long time but has always struggled to capture the market even back when Yahoo was bigger than Google (remember then). Facebook also was never really popular in China. Facebook may have more success in the Chinese market by taking a stake in Chinese social media firms in just the same way that Yahoo has a huge stake in Alibaba.

As of May 2016, the only countries to ban access around the clock to the social networking site are China, Iran, and North Korea. However, since the vast majority of North Korean residents do not have access to the internet, in reality China and Iran are the only countries where access to Facebook is actively restricted in a wholesale manner.  Bangladesh banned Facebook for a short period of time among the four nations including Iran,China & North Korea. The Awami League-led government of Bangladesh announced a countrywide ban on Facebook and other social network websites. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina proposed the establishment of an Internet monitoring committee with the help of Bangladesh's intelligence services. Previously the government has been blocking websites. Right-wing political parties and groups in Bangladesh have been protesting bloggers and others they consider \"blasphemous\"; at the time of the proposal, eight secularists had been murdered by extremists in the country, including atheist blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider, who was fatally stabbed in February 2013. National riots over country's war crimes trials have killed 56 people between 19 January 2013 and 2 March 2013.[5][6][7]  On 18 November 2015, the same Awami League government banned Facebook again on the eve of the final judgement of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami leader Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mujahid and Bangladesh Nationalist Party leader Salauddin Kader Chowdhury. Both the politicians and previous minister have been issued a death sentence by the War Criminals Tribunal and the review board of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh has finally given their judgement in favour of the previously given one.  The Bangladesh Government lifted the ban on 20 December 2015 after about 22 days only.It was not that typical type of Ban but only to handle the situation when the rumours spreaded through social medias.This lifting of the ban has made the users happy again.  In China, Facebook was blocked following the July 2009 rmqi riots[2] because Xinjiang independence activists were using Facebook as part of their communications network.[8] Some Chinese users also believed that Facebook would not succeed in China after Google China's problems.[9] The popular Renren social network (formerly Xiaonei) has many features similar to Facebook, and complies with PRC Government regulations regarding content filtering.  As of 20 August 2013, there have been reports of Facebook being partially unblocked in China.[10] But according to the \"Blocked in China\" website, Facebook is still blocked.[11] However, it is not blocked in Hong Kong and Taiwan. It is possible to access Facebook in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone.[12]  Facebook was blocked for a few days in Egypt during the 2011 Egyptian protests.[13]  In July 2011, authorities in Germany began to discuss the prohibition of events organized on Facebook. The decision is based on numerous cases of overcrowding by people who were not originally invited.[14][15] In one instance, 1,600 \"guests\" attended the 16th birthday party for a Hamburg girl who accidentally posted the invitation for the event as public. After reports of overcrowding, more than a hundred police were deployed for crowd control. A police officer was injured and eleven participants were arrested for assault, property damage and resistance to authorities.[16] In another unexpectedly overcrowded event, 41 young people were arrested and at least 16 injured.[17]  In 2015, during the refugee crisis with large numbers of immigrants entering the country unregulated, a broad discussion about the problems of mass immigration and politics of the actual government took place in social media. In this situation a campaign was started to force Facebook to erase right wing hate speech. Early in 2016, a Bertelsmann company called \"Arvato\" was mandated to erase comments and contents from Facebook.[18] Rules and procedure for that censorship, as well as the juridical base is not clear at the moment (January 2016).  After the 2009 election in Iran, the website was banned because of fears that opposition movements were being organized on the website.[3] However, after four years of the blocking of Facebook website, as of September 2013, the blocking of both Twitter and Facebook was thought to have been lifted without notice.[19] Iranians lost unrestricted access to Facebook and Twitter the next day, leaving many people wondering whether the opening was deliberate or the result of some technical glitch.[20]  Facebook was blocked for a few days in Malaysia during the 2011 Egyptian protests.[13]  The Information and Communication Technologies Authority (ICTA) of Mauritius, ordered Internet Service Providers(ISPs) of the country to ban Facebook on immediate effect, on the 8 November 2007 because of a fake profile page of the Prime Minister. Access to Facebook was restored on the next day.[21][22][23]  On February 5, 2008, Fouad Mourtada, a citizen of Morocco, was arrested for the alleged creation of a faked Facebook profile of Prince Moulay Rachid of Morocco.[24][25]  From April 2016, North Korea starts to block Facebook, for \"move underscoring its concern with the spread of online information\". Anyone who tries to access it, even with authorization, will be subject to punishment.[4]  The Syrian government explained their ban by claiming the website promoted attacks on authorities.[26][27] The government also feared Israeli infiltration of Syrian social networks on Facebook.[26] Facebook was also used by Syrian citizens to criticize the government of Syria, as public criticism of the Syrian government used to be punishable by imprisonment.[26] In February 2011, Facebook was un-blocked from all ISP's and the website remains to be accessible.  In November 2012, Tajikistan blocked access to Facebook in response to comments posted online, spreading mud and slander about President Emomalii Rahmon and various other officials.[28]  In the United Kingdom on April 28, 2011, the day before the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, a number of politically motivated Facebook groups and pages were removed or suspended from the website as part of a nationwide crackdown on political activity. The groups and pages were mostly concerned with opposition to government spending cuts, and many were used to organize demonstrations in a continuation of the 2010 UK student protests.[29][30][31] The censorship of the pages coincided with a series of pre-emptive arrests of known activists.[32] Amongst the arrestees were a street theater group planning an effigy beheading performance in opposition to the monarchy.[33]  A Facebook spokesman said the pages were disabled as part of a routine sweep because they were created with fake personal profiles, a violation of the companys term of service. In this case a number of the Facebook personal profile pages represented causes, rather than real people. Facebook \"offered to help convert the profiles to pages that are designed to represent companies, groups or causes.\"[31] The spokesman went on to say that \"the Met Police did not ask Facebook to take down this content.\"[30]  Facebook was blocked in Vietnam for 2 weekends in May 2016 due to protest of Vit Tn.[34]";fact

Emilio, who holds a masters degree in City and Regional Planning from Berkeley and a bachelors degree in Urban Studies from Stanford, can be contacted on or by .  During her career in government, Hillary Clinton has routinely prioritized the interests of corporate profiteers while neglecting the rights of workers. Her support of so-called free trade agreements in particular illustrates where her priorities lie.  While in the Senate, for example, Clinton backed agreements with Chile, Singapore, and Oman despite their clear lack of labor protections. As David Sirota and Matthew Cunningham-Cook for the International Business Times:  In some cases, Clinton even directly worked against improved labor standards for workers in other countries. In , Dan Coughlin and Kim Ives utilize content from cables obtained by WikiLeaks to describe how Secretary Clintons State Department lobbied the Haitian president to help multinational clothing retailers undermine a minimum wage increase unanimously passed by the Haitian Parliament:  Contractors for Fruit of the Loom, Hanes and Levis worked in close concert with the US Embassy when they aggressively moved to block a minimum wage increase for Haitian assembly zone workers, the lowest-paid in the hemisphere, according to secret State Department cables. The factory owners told the Haitian Parliament that they were willing to give workers a 9-cents-per-hour pay increase to 31 cents per hour to make T-shirts, bras and underwear for US clothing giants like Dockers and Nautica. But the factory owners refused to pay 62 cents per hour, or $5 per day, as a measure unanimously passed by the Haitian Parliament in June 2009 would have mandated. And they had the vigorous backing of the US Agency for International Development and the US Embassy when theytook that stand. To resolve the impasse between the factory owners and Parliament, the State Department urged quick intervention by then Haitian President Ren Prval. A more visible and active engagement by Prval may be critical to resolving the issue of the minimum wage and its protest spin-offor risk the political environment spiraling out of control, argued US Ambassador Janet Sanderson in a June 10, 2009, cable back to Washington. Two months later Prval negotiated a deal with Parliament to create a two-tiered minimum wage increaseone for the textile industry at about $3 per day and one for all other industrial and commercial sectors at about $5 per day.  Clintons record is very similar when it comes to the most recent free trade agreement  the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). The TPP has been the subject of well-deserved scrutiny, and not just from liberals like the Economic Policy Institutes , Senators and , and former US Labor Secretaries F. Ray Marshall and Robert Reich. Former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, the economist famous for, among many things, his role in the deregulation of the US financial system, has also raised doubts about the merits of the agreement. Heres Summers in a for The Washington Post:  First, the era of agreements that achieve freer trade in the classic sense is essentially over. The worlds remaining tariff and quota barriers are small and, where present, less reflections of the triumph of protectionist interests and more a result of deep cultural values such as the Japanese attachment to rice farming A reflexive presumption in favor of free trade should not be used to justify further agreements. Concerns that trade agreements may be a means to circumvent traditional procedures for taking up issues ranging from immigration to financial regulation must be taken seriously [The US economy] has supported the greatest economic progress in the history of the world in emerging markets and is working spectacularly well for capital and a cosmopolitan elite that moves easily around the world. But being pressed down everywhere are middle classes who lack the wherewithal to take advantage of new global markets and do not want to compete with low-cost foreign labor. Our challenge now is less to increase globalization than to make the globalization we have work for our citizens.  In that respect, the TPP doesnt look good. Scott discusses how free trade has historically depressed US wages and why the lack of enforceable currency provisions in the agreement could lead to job losses. Reich and Marshall caution that its patent provisions risk delaying or even preventing generic competition, thus keeping lifesaving medicine out of patients hands. Warren details how the agreements Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) provisions would allow big multinationals to weaken labor and environmental rules and why, despite the fact that the TPP is being hailed as the strongest free trade agreement yet, our terrible enforcement record when it comes to previous agreements (and the same empty promise being made over and over again) belies that claim.  What does all of that have to do with Clinton? As Sirota and Cunningham-Cook note, Clinton was a strong supporter of the TPP during negotiations:  But that was just one speech, right? Wrong.  In a , Clinton explicitly promoted the TPP as an initiative that will lower barriers, raise standards, and drive long-term growth across the region. She also used the collective we in describing the work being done on the pact, saying, we are making progress toward finalizing a far-reaching new trade agreement called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. She also saidwe are offering to assist with capacity building, so that every country in ASEAN can eventually join. The video of the key part of her speech can be seen here:  In fact, even CNN, which judging from the recent Democratic primary debate seems to unabashedly favor Clinton, published an article listing 45 times that Secretary Clinton pushed the very trade bill that she now claims to oppose  Her flip-flop, as Sirota and Cunningham-Cook note, is typical:  Though she has tried to justify her reversal this time around, her claims are unconvincing.As at Vox:  Why not?Because, as Lee describes, the pharmaceutical language in the TPP is better than expected and currency manipulation was never going to be part of the TPP. If Clinton was serious when she lauded the gold standard TPP for free, transparent, fair trade in 2012, she should be even more supportive of the deal now. Instead, the minute that the TPP became widely unpopular, she changed her position, saying that it didnt meet the high bar she had set for it.  I can only draw three logical conclusions from these remarkable contradictions:  Unfortunately, none of these conclusions give me any reassurance that it would be a good idea to entrust Clinton with more political power.";fact

Clinton announced last week that she no longer supports the international trade deal, despite supporting it while serving as secretary of state -- once calling it the \"gold standard.\" CNN anchor and debate moderator Anderson Cooper picked up on those words and asked Clinton about her reversal at the Oct. 13 debate in Las Vegas.  \"I did say, when I was secretary of state, three years ago, that I hoped it would be the gold standard,\" Clinton said. \"It was just finally negotiated last week, and in looking at it, it didn't meet my standards. My standards for more new, good jobs for Americans, for raising wages for Americans. And I want to make sure that I can look into the eyes of any middle-class American and say, this will help raise your wages. And I concluded I could not.\"  Clintons phrasing -- that she said she \"hoped it would be the gold standard\" -- implies that she was undecided on the TPP. But that doesnt exactly match up to her prior comments. We found that her previous remarks actually gave the impression that she had confidence in the deal as it stood.  In Australia in 2012, Clinton delivered remarks on the general topic of the U.S.-Australia relationship. Heres everything she said about the TPP in that address, with the \"gold standard\" comment in bold.  \"So it's fair to say that our economies are entwined, and we need to keep upping our game both bilaterally and with partners across the region through agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership or TPP. Australia is a critical partner. This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field. And when negotiated, this agreement will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment.\"  So it seems Clinton is saying the TPP does, definitevely set the gold standard -- as opposed to Clinton hoping it will.  In other addresses around the same time, she expressed similar assuredness that the TPP would meet a high standard. In November 2012 remarks in Singapore, she encouraged all nations \"willing to meet 21st century standards as embodied in the TPP\" to join the deal.  \"The so-called TPP will lower barriers, raise standards, and drive long-term growth across the region. It will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade and establish strong protections for workers and the environment. Better jobs with higher wages and safer working conditions, including for women, migrant workers and others too often in the past excluded from the formal economy will help build Asia's middle class and rebalance the global economy. Canada and Mexico have already joined the original TPP partners. We continue to consult with Japan. And we are offering to assist with capacity building, so that every country in ASEAN can eventually join. We welcome the interest of any nation willing to meet 21st century standards as embodied in the TPP, including China.\"  Here are some of the other words Clinton used to describe the TPP before she left the State Department in 2013: \"exciting,\" \"innovative,\" \"ambitious,\" \"groundbreaking,\" \"cutting-edge,\" \"high-quality\" and \"high-standard.\" (To read more of her comments in full, check out our previous article on this subject.)  As a presidential candidate Clinton has used more hedging language, for example saying she has \"some concerns,\" and now she has said she outright doesnt support the deal as it stands.  In her 2014 memoir Hard Choices, she wrote:  \"Because TPP negotiations are still ongoing, it makes sense to reserve judgment until we can evaluate the final proposed agreement. Its safe to say the TPP wont be perfect -- no deal negotiated among a dozen countries ever will be -- but its higher standards, if implemented and enforced, should benefit American businesses and workers.\"  In fairness to Clinton, the TPP was still under negotiation when Clinton made the \"gold standard\" comment. The partners only finalized the deal this year. Its quite possible the deal looks dramatically different than it did at the early stages of negotiations, when Clinton was at the State Department -- something Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill pointed out to us for this fact-check. The negotiations have been conducted in secret, so its hard for us to assess that ourselves. Also, as secretary of state, she spoke as a representative of the Obama administration, which was and remains wholeheartedly in favor of the deal.  Clinton said when she was secretary of state, she was reserving judgment but \"hoped (the Trans-Pacific Partnership) would be the gold standard.\"  Shes twisting her 2012 remarks a bit. Clinton said, \"This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements,\" which is a more confident claim than if she had said she \"hoped\" it would meet that standard. This is in contrast to more recent comments where Clinton said she had concerns about the deal and that she ultimately opposes it.  The statement is distorting her previous comments.

CLINTON: Well, thats your opinion. That is your opinion.

It has not yet been ratified by the United States.  Assecretary of state, Hillary Clinton spoke favorably of the agreement-in-progress on severaloccasions. For example:  We want to realize the benefits from greater economic integration. In order to do that, we have to be willing to play. To this end, we are working to ratify a free trade agreement with South Korea, were pursuing a regional agreement with the nations of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and we know that that will help create new jobs and opportunities here at home. (8 September 2010)  After leaving the State Department in 2013, however, Clintons remarks about the TPP became more guarded. Because TPP negotiations are still ongoing, she wrote in her 2014 book, Hard Choices,it makes sense to reserve judgment until we can evaluate the final proposed agreement. By the time of her October 2015 debate with Democratic rivalBernie Sanders, Clinton was foursquare against it:  I did say, when I was secretary of state, three years ago, that I hoped it would be the gold standard. It was just finally negotiated last week, and in looking at it, it didnt meet my standards. My standards for more new, good jobs for Americans, for raising wages for Americans. And I want to make sure that I can look into the eyes of any middle-class American and say, This will help raise your wages. And I concluded I could not.  Despite her current opposition to the agreement and herattempts during more than one presidential debate to recast her previous support of itas hopeful, the record shows that Clintonspoke glowinglyof the TPP on more than one occasion, not least when she praisedit in 2012 as setting the gold standard in trade agreements.";fact
model;"Hillary Clinton once lauded the Trans-Pacific Partnership (which she later opposed) as setting the gold standard in trade agreements.";"Hillary Clinton once lauded the Trans-Pacific Partnership (which she later opposed) as setting the gold standard in trade agreements.";"Donald Trump has made opposition to multilateral trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement and the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership a staple of his case against Hillary Clinton. And he quickly took the conversation there Monday.  He says she supported the former, whichthe U.S.entered into during her husbands administration, and the latter, which she helped negotiate as secretary of State.  In fact, Trump argued, Clinton decided to oppose TPP only after she saw the popularresponse Trump was getting for his position.  But Clinton has maintained she opposes TPP, a position she has been forced to reiterate with greater clarity.  I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages including the Trans-Pacific Partnership, she said at a campaign stop in Ohio in August. I oppose it now, Ill oppose it after the election, and Ill oppose it as president.  So did Clinton flip on TPP? Context is key.  The deal would be the largest multilateral trade agreement ever negotiated, involving the U.S.,emerging economies such asVietnam andtraditional trading partners includingJapan, Canada and Mexico. Its a major priority for the Obama administration, which sees the deal as key to cementing the presidents so-called pivot to the Asia-Pacific region. Obama hopes to persuade lawmakers to ratify it before years end, but Clintons opposition now exemplifies the political difficulty.  As a member of the Obama Cabinet in his first term, Clinton carried out the presidentspriorities.Speaking on a trip to Australia in 2012 as negotiators from the partner nations were still deep in negotiations, she outlined the goals for it.  This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field, she said then. And when negotiated, this agreement will cover 40%of the world's total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment. That's keybecause we know from experience, and of course research proves it, that respecting workers' rights leads to positive long-term economic outcomes, better jobs with higher wages and safer working conditions.  After she left the Obama administration, Clintons rhetoric shifted more to express her own views. In her 2014 memoir, Hard Choices, she wrote about the administrations renewed engagement with Vietnam and said the TPP was one of our most important tools for doing so.  Our country has learned the hard way over the past several decades that globalization and the expansion of international trade brings costs as well as benefits, she wrote, while noting that she and Obama had both promised in the 2008 campaign to pursue smarter, fairer trade agreements.  Because TPP negotiations are still ongoing, it makes sense to reserve judgment until we can evaluate the final agreement, she added. Its safe to say that the TPP wont be perfect  but its higher standards, if implemented and enforced, should benefit American businesses and workers.  Final negotiations on the deal concluded in October 2015, just as the scope of the challenge Clinton faced in the Democratic primaries became clearer. Her main rival, VermontSen. Bernie Sanders, quickly vowed to block the deal. Clinton ultimately stated her opposition after taking time to study it.  I still believe in the goal of a strong and fair trade agreement in the Pacific as part of a broader strategy both at home and abroad, just as I did when I was secretary of State, she said in a statement. But the bar here is very high and, based on what I have seen, I don't believe this agreement has met it.  As a senator, Clinton voted against the only multilateral trade agreement that was considered during her tenure: the Central American Free Trade Agreement. She did support separate bilateral agreements with Chile, Singapore, Australia, Morocco, Bahrain and Oman, according to Politifact.

Analysis: The story supposed to be an important message from Delhi police states that a worker from Frooti company has added his blood, contaminated with HIV (AIDS), and so, you should not drink any product of Frooti for the next few weeks. The story also claims that this public warning was shown on NDTV. However, all this is complete hoax. Firstly, Delhi police did not issue any such warning, and neither did NDTV show this message. HIV can NOT spread through food contamination. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) clearly states that a person would not become infected with HIV even if he consumed food containing HIV infected blood. \"HIV does not live long outside the body. Even if small amounts of HIV-infected blood or semen was consumed, exposure to the air, heat from cooking, and stomach acid would destroy the virus. Therefore, there is no risk of contracting HIV from eating food.\" Therefore, it is quite clear that this message of Frooti containing HIV is yet another hoax to scare people in the name of health. This is in fact another version of an old hoax talking about HIV in Pepsi .The message need not be shared. References: ";hoax

Since the employee was infected so he has put his blood in pre-packaged product. It is said that this message was issued by Manila police and all the TV news channels were covering it. It also says to forward this message to maximum people. Our conclusion  If we study the Ebola virus, then we will come to know that the Ebola can be transmitted through contact with infected blood, semen or vaginal fluids. So this message is complete nonsense and nothing else. None of the news sources can be validated. No information is given by Manila Police as well. So, this rumour is highly illogical and baseless.

Versions of the same rumor have made the rounds previously, in 2004, and again in 2007-2008 . In those previous instances the food products allegedly contaminated with HIV-positive blood were ketchup and tomato sauce, but the status of the claim was the same: false. No legitimate sources, media or governmental, have reported any such occurrence. Moreover, even if such an incident had occurred, it would not have resulted in the spread of AIDS. So say medical experts . No one is saying that it's absolutely impossible for HIV-tainted blood or other bodily fluids to find their way, accidentally or on purpose, into foods and beverages; the point is that, according to the best scientific evidence available, the AIDS virus simply can't be transmitted from one person to another in that way. This is how the CDC explains it: HIV does not live long outside the body. Even if small amounts of HIV-infected blood or semen was consumed, exposure to the air, heat from cooking, and stomach acid would destroy the virus. Therefore, there is no risk of contracting HIV from eating food. [ Source ] As stated in a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention fact sheet last updated in 2010, no incidents of food or beverage products being contaminated with HIV-infected blood or semen, and no incidents of HIV infection transmitted via food or beverage products, have ever been documented by the agency.

Christensen June 6, 2016 Outline: Circulating Facebook message warns users not to consumeCool Drink because a company worker has added bloodcontaminated with Ebola virus to the product. Brief Analysis: The claims in the warning message are nonsense. There are no credible reports of such a contamination and Ebolais not spread by consuming commercial food or drink. The message is just a revamped version of several earlier contamination hoaxes and should not be taken seriously. Example: Important message from manila police to all over philippines and india: for the next few weeks do not drink any product of COOL DRINK as a worker from the company has added his blood contaminated with Ebola virus. It was shown yesterday on NDTV news. Pls forward this msg urgently to people you care Take care Detailed Analysis: According to a post circulating via Facebook, you should not drink any product called Cool Drink over coming weeks because a worker has contaminated the productwith hisEbola infected blood. Supposedly, the important message was issued by Manila Police and aired on TV news. It asks that you urgently forward the information to people that you care about so that they will be forewarned of the danger. The message features an image depicting a diseased human hand. However, the claims in the would-be warning are utter nonsense. There are no credible news reports that support the claims in the message. Nor is the supposed contamination mentioned on the Manilla Police District website or any other offical police or health authority outlet. Moreover, there is no evidence that Ebolacan bespread by eating or drinking commercial food or beverages. In a Q&A about Ebola, the CDC notes that : Ebola virus is not spread by consuming food, with the possible exception of bushmeat. And: There is no evidence that foods produced commercially have ever transmitted Ebola virus anywhere in the world. In fact, the message is just a revamped version of earlier hoaxes that falsely claimed that a worker had deliberately contaminated other commercial beverageswith HIV or Ebola infected blood: URGENT !!!!Please,dont buy or drink any bottled water called DEW. Customs says it was shipped into Nigeria from Tanzania where it has killed 180 people and now finding its way into south africa. It is said to contain ebola. Please pass this on and save millions.

And, an almost identical version of the hoax claimed that it was the fruit drink product Maaza thathad been contaminated: Important msg from Hyderabad police to all over India: For the next few weeks do not drink any product of Maaza, as a worker from the company has added his blood contaminated with Ebola. It was shown yesterday on NDTV Pls forward this msg urgently to people you care Take Care!! The rather vague reference to Cool Drink in the message may be referring to all types of soft drink rather than just one product. The slang term cooldrink isaSouth African English word for soft drink. Sending on these false contamination warnings willserve only to spread fear and alarm and will certainly not help keep anybody safe from Ebola, HIV, or any other health threat. If you receive one of these false warnings, do not share it on your networks. And please let the sender know the information is untrue.

Analysis: The story doing rounds online through social networking websites, including the free messaging service WhatsApp, warns consumers not to drink any product of Maaza saying that a worker from the Company has added his blood contaminated with Ebola virus. The warning supposedly coming from Hyderabad police in India is said to have been shown on NDTV as well. Readers need not share the health warning, as it is a hoax. The current story about Ebola contamination in Maaza appeared online last year in 2014 during the Ebola outbreak; it surfaced again in 2015. Yes, it is a fact that Ebola virus can spread through infected blood among many other transmission sources , but there is no evidence to prove that such an incident where a worker has contaminated a Maaza product with his Ebola contained blood has happened. Hyderabad police did not issue any such warning, and neither did NDTV show the message. Old Story Refabricated As a matter of fact, the Ebola story in question is simply a refabricated version of an old hoax story supposedly coming from Delhi police that stated a worker from Frooti Company has added to the drink his blood contaminated with HIV (AIDS). Very similar HIV warning surfaced in case of Pepsi as well. ";hoax

It ws shown yesterday on NDTV Pls forward this msg urgently to people you care Take Care!!  Origins:  This warning about HIV-contaminated Pepsi products began spreading on the Internet and via cell phone text message in July 2011 (and experienced a resurgence in September 2012), and it has also been echoed in recurrent rumors about Mango Frooti , a popular beverage in India.  Such rumors are standard food contamination urban legends akin to the leper in the Chesterfield factory rumor. No news accounts, government agencies, or other reliable sources have reported Pepsi or Frooti products being contaminated with HIV-infected blood. In May 2013, Parie Agro (Frootis parent company) responded to these rumors by posting the following message on its Facebook page: Drawing your attention to the baseless rumour floating around that Frooti contains HIV blood, we assure you that this is a rumour and holds no credibility. Sadly, a lot of renowned beverage brands have been faced with the same unjustified rumor. The Delhi police and the news channel NDTV have confirmed to Parie Agro that this is not something that they have circulated and they are investigating the matter, since their credentials have been used in the rumour that has been spreading. It would be our privilege to personally organise a visit for you to any of our 50 manufacturing facilities, a testament to quality and hygiene. Here, based on our manufacturing process, youll see how something like putting blood in a product is absolutely impossible. As for whether people can acquire HIV via contaminated food or beverages, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) emphatically says they cannot : No incident of food being contaminated with HIV-infected blood or semen has been reported to CDC. Furthermore, CDC has received no reports of HIV infection resulting from eating food, including condiments. HIV does not live long outside the body. Even if small amounts of HIV-infected blood or semen was consumed, exposure to the air, heat from cooking, and stomach acid would destroy the virus. Therefore, there is no risk of contracting HIV from eating food. HIV does not long survive outside its host medium of human bodily fluids: blood, semen, vaginal fluid, breast milk, saliva, tears. (Which is not to say HIV can be transmitted by every one of those: according to the CDC, Contact with saliva, tears, or sweat has never been shown to result in transmission of HIV.) The CDC says except under laboratory conditions, HIV is unable to reproduce outside its living host; it does not spread or maintain infectiousness outside its host. Therefore, were HIV-tainted blood to be mixed into foodstuffs or beverages, the virus would neither survive nor while it was still viable multiply and so replenish itself. Although such cases are rare, the CDC confirms that people have acquired HIV through oral contact with, or swallowing of, HIV-laden bodily fluids. However, no known infections involving oral transmission of HIV have so far come from contact with, or ingestion of, a food product or beverage; all such infections involved sexual contact. Other ingestibles have previously been fingered as vehicles for the transmission of HIV-infected blood to the unsuspecting public, and these stories too were baseless: The 2004 scare about restaurant ketchup dispensers and the 2005-2006 Last updated:  15 May 2014 Snopes Delivered to Your Inbox: ";hoax

Adults males can eat up to 88 pounds of meat in one sitting! Thats 44kg  How much do you weigh? A lions roar can be heard from 8 kilometers (5.0 miles) away. Equipped with teeth that tear effortlessly through bone and tendon, lions can take down an animal as large as a bull giraffe. Once grabbed, the prey is subdued and suffocated with a quick neck bite or a sustained bite over the muzzle. How To Survive A Lion Attack: If you encounter a lion, never turn your back and try to run. That is a death warrant. Your best chance is to stand as still as possible, stretch out your arms to look as large as possible, and try to outface the lion!  A crocodile can snap their jaws shut around prey within 50 milliseconds. Crocodiles have the strongest bite of any animal in the world.The muscles that open the jaws, however, arent so powerful. A reasonably strong person could hold a crocodiles jaw closed with their bare hands! Each crocodile jaw has 24 teeth that are meant to grasp and crush, not chew. They swallow stones to grind food inside their stomachs. Crying crocodile tears  displaying fake sadness  comes from the myth that the reptiles weep when eating humans. They do wipe their eyes when feeding, but only because their eyes bubble and froth when eating. How To Survive ACrocodile Attack: Most victims never see the crocodile coming. If caught in its jaws, trying to pull free is usually futile and may induce the crocodile to go into an underwater death roll. The only hope of survival is to fight back. Hit or poke the eyes, the most vulnerable part of a crocodiles body. If that fails, strike the nostrils or ears. As a last ditch attempt, go for the palatal valve  a flap of tissue behind the tongue that covers the crocodiles throat and prevents the animal from drowning. If your arm is stuck in a crocodiles mouth, you may be able to pry this valve down, water will then flow into the crocodiles throat, and hopefully it will let you go.  The fastest snake in the world, capable of moving at up to 19 km per hour for short distances. Its venom is highly toxic. Two drops of venom can kill a person and a mamba can have up to 20 drops in its fangs. Black mambas get their name because of the black color inside their mouth (their bodies are usually olive brown). Easily identified by its length (2.4m average), slenderness, speed of movement and its coffin-shaped head. The black mamba has a reputation for being very aggressive. How To Survive ABlack Mamba Attack: Untreated bites are fatal. Put a tourniquet above the puncture wound to slow the spread of poison and seek medical attention immediately. The sooner a person is treated after the bite with antidote, the better the chances of survival.  Extremely aggressive if threatened, the hippo is responsible for more human fatalities in Africa than any other large animal. Hippos can easily outrun a human reaching up to 50km per hour. Most common threat display is the yawn, which is telling you to back off! An overheated hippo looks as if it is sweating blood as glands in its skin secrete a sticky red fluid that acts as a natural sunscreen. How To Survive AHippo Attack: Never get between a hippo and water. It panics them and they charge. Most human deaths happen because people surprise hippos accidentally.";unrelated

We asked Susan Bass, director of public relations at Big Cat Rescue in Tampa, Floridayou know, the place that puts out all those awesome videosto walk us through what behaviors big cats share with their domestic counterparts. (And dont worryweve put in a request for sitting on computers and hanging out in the sink videos.)  It's a scenario familiar to anyone with a kitty: You come home, head to the bathroom ... and find a toilet paper massacre. When the staff at Big Cat Rescue put TP in enclosures of servals, bobcats, lynx, and ocelots, they found that even big cats love to play with white tissue. \"Theyre going to be more curious about anything new in their immediate area,\" Bass says. Also, it's just plain fun! (For them. Not for whoever has to clean it up/reroll the toilet paper.)  If you present a big cat with a box, he'll hop in it quicker than you can say Maru. \"Just like domestic cats, big cats like to hide in things,\" Bass says. \"They like to think that they can see out but you cant see ineven though you can!\"  The cats at Big Cat Rescue are also into bags, though probably not in the same way that domestic cats are. \"We havent tried bags that they can get intoI dont know where we would find one big enough!\" Bass says. \"But we give them paper bags filled with either spices or cologne. Our big cats love Obsession for Men. They just start drooling and rolling over.\"  If the cats were presented with a bag big enough to get into, Bass says, \"they would probably rip through it.\"  No feline can resist the \"What is that red dotoh I got itwhere did it go?\" appeal of the laser pointer, big cats included. \"I think they like that it moves really fast,\" Bass says. \"They have to chase it. You can go up a wall, under things, like I do with my cat. Theyre just fascinated with it.\"  Domestic cats spend between 30 and 50 percent of their waking hours grooming; big cats are similarly fastidious about cleaning themselves. \"Its to get all of their scent off of them,\" Bass says. \"In the wild, if theyre lying in wait somewhere, and a gazelle gets a whiff of a tiger downwind, theyre going to run the other way. So cats are constantly are grooming themselves to get rid of any smell that they have.\" Cleaning has a number of other benefits, too; it helps cats get rid of parasites and keeps them cool.  It's all about marking their territory. Both big cats and domestic cats \"have scent glands all overin their faces, especially,\" Bass says. \"So they rub against their things, whether its the side of a couch, the side of the cage, or a tree. Or you!\"  Big cats also scratch to mark their territory. With the exception of lions, which roam in prides, big cats are solitary, Bass says; tiger cubs, for example, will stay with their mothers for just two years before striking out on their own. \"If you are a 2-year-old male tiger and youre wandering through the wild, and you come on these trees where there are claw marks in all the trees about 8 to 10 feet upthats because a tiger will stand on his back legs and put his front paws up as high as possible and scratch right there,\" Bass says. \"Thats telling every tiger that comes into its territory, This is how big I am, I can scratch way up here. If you cant scratch higher, you better keep moving.'  Your cat meows, chirps, and purrs. Big cats have their own vocalizations, too, and some of them sound kind of similar to the noises your cat makes. \"There are four great catslions, tigers, leopards, and jaguarsand they roar,\" Bass says. \"They have a different bone in their throat that allows them to do that.\" The so-called lesser cats (but come on, we all know there's no such thing as \"lesser cats\"), including cougars, lynx, and bobcats, can't roar. \"It's probably because of where they live,\" Bass says. \"Lions live on the savannahs in Africa. A lions roar can be heard by another lion at least five miles away. They have to be able to do that. A Canadian lynx that lives in the snow in Canada doesn't need to roar to get its point across.\"  But a roar is just one way big cats converse. \"They all talk,\" Bass says. \"They all make different noises.\" The lesser cats can all purr, and tigers make a chuffing noise, \"like a puffing out of their lips,\" Bass says, in greeting. \"Like my tabby cats, big cats will talk to their people. Some cats are very talkative and some dont make very many sounds. One of our cougars, Reise, is really talkative. If you just walk by her, all of a sudden shell be like 'bluh-ruh ruh ruh.'\" You can watch Reise playing soccer here.  Fun fact: The young of the four great cats are called cubs, but the offspring of the lesser cats are called kittens!  Or at least some of them are. Responsiveness to catnip is genetic, and half the domestic cats in the world don't respond to it at all. \"Its the same thing with big cats,\" Bass says. \"Some like it much more than others.\" In one test, 18 of the sanctuary's 25 cats had a strong reaction to catnip.  Your cat spends most of her day sleeping, and so do her big relativesbetween 16 to 20 hours a day, in fact. \"The reason for that is because in the wild, they are opportunity hunters,\" Bass says. \"They will sprint to catch prey, but theyre not marathon runners. They will sleep to keep their energy intact. They can go from totally asleep to totally awake in a split second if they hear a gazelle go by.\"  Speaking of hunting: All cats, big and small, will stalk their prey. \"Zabu, our white tiger, is a real stalker,\" Bass says. \"If she sees anyone go by, or golf carts go across, she'll stalk them.\"  My kitten, Pearl, refuses to eat her food in her bowl. Instead, she shovels it onto the ground and then eats it, making a huge mess. (Thanks, Pearl.) Bass says some captive big cats will move their food to the ground to eat, too. \"Some are very food aggressive,\" Bass says. \"If there's more than one cat in an enclosure, we separate them before we bring the food by. One will start gobbling it up and then go to the other ones food.\"  Another weird thing some domestic cats do is paw around their food bowls, which also has its roots in wild cat behavior. In the wild, the cats might only catch something once a week or so, and they won't eat it all at once,\" Bass says. \"They want to leave and come back to eat again, so they will actually try and bury their kill so others dont smell it and eat it. Other cats, like leopards, will drag their kill high into a tree, where other not-so-talented climbers (lions in Africa and tigers in Asia) cant go.  Big cats sometimes make biscuits, too! \"It's probably for the same reason house cats do it,\" Bass says. \"It's natural to do it as they nurse as babies, and sometimes they continue to do it after they are past nursing when they are happy.\"  Both domestic cats and big cats have an excellent sense of smell. \"Humans smell in parts per thousand, while cats smell in parts per million,\" Bass says. And if they smell something really strong, they'll open up their mouths to get a better whiffan act the staff at Big Cat Rescue call \"stinky face.\" \"Opening their mouth helps them smell it better than just out of their nose,\" Bass says.";unrelated

This is a fact that you think people would already know by now but no, this girl had to annoy a lion. This happened at Tucson, Arizonas Reid Park Zoo and it looks like the girl really wanted to piss of the caged animal.  What happened next drove everyone wild.  First, the lion made a fake attack and next, he showed them whos the real boss.  I literally laughed out loud at this. Hopefully the girl learned her lesson. It doesnt always mean that just because an animal is in a glass cage that he couldnt fight back in any way. The lion must be having a bad day!  Lions have always been a symbol of strength, power and ferocity, as described in a blog by the WorldWildLife.  Here are some quick facts weve gathered from the site about the king of the jungle:  1. A lion may sleep up to 20 hours a day. 2. A lions heels dont touch the ground when it walks. 3. A good gauge of a male lions age is the darkness of his mane. The darker the mane, the older the lion. 4. Even though the lion is sometimes referred to as the king of the jungle, it actually only lives in grasslands and plains. The expression may have come from an incorrect association between Africa and jungles or may refer to a less literal meaning of the word jungle. 5. A lion can run for short distances at 50 mph and leap as far as 36 feet. 6. A lions roar can be heard from as far as 5 miles away. 7. The lion was once found throughout Africa, Asia and Europe but now exists only in Africa with one exception. The last remaining Asiatic lions are found in Sasan-Gir National Park in India, which was primarily created to protect the species. Currently, there are approximately 350-400 lions in the park. 8. These majestic cats are threatened by habitat loss. The lion is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. 9. Male lions defend the prides territory while females do most of the hunting. Despite this, the males eat first. 10.

Another possible danger is that governments could forcefully take out data from the microchips.  I want to make sure its treated as part of the body, like an organ, says Amal.

SeeExample(s)  The prospect of governments forcingcitizens toundergo microchip implants fortracking or other purposes is of perennial concern to the conspiracy-minded, so much so that any mention of chip implants in the news is enough to spark apocalyptic howls.  Consider this August 2016 item out of Australia: Australians Embracing Super-Human Microchip Technology. Its a fluff pieceabout a Sydney biohacking entrepreneur namedShanti Korporaal whose business isarranging for people to get microchip implants if they want them  as in,voluntarily. Theres nothing in the original article about government programs, or mandated chipping, or anything of the kind, yet this is how the same story was reworked for Internet consumption by a web site called Organic & Healthy:  Australia Becomes First Country To Begin Microchipping Its Public Back in 2010, CBS news reported that the Australian government had a potential RFID microchipping plan in the works related to the health care system. Now, it seems that this plan is beginning to unfold but the push is not a result of mandated health care reforms, but rather a clever propaganda campaign that equates RFID microchipping with becoming superhuman, and people are begging for it. It may sound like sci-fi, but hundreds of Australians are turning themselves into super-humans who can unlock doors, turn on lights and log into computers with a wave of the hand. Shanti Korporaal, from Sydney, is at the centre of the phenomenon after having two implants inserted under her skin.   Again, theres nothing in the original report,nor any additional information provided in the reworked version, to support the claim that Australia is microchipping its public. To the contrary, all that has been reported is that a fewAustralian techno-hipsters have begun microchippingthemselves on the assumption that this will one day be a useful technology. For that matter, Australia isnt even the first country where self-chipping has taken place; its been going on in the U.S. for years.  Australia has not begun microchipping its public. The claim that it has is, at best, misinformation and, at worst, a lie.  And its also not true that, as claimed in the example at the head of this page, NBC predicted that all Americans will receive a microchip implant in 2017.";hoax

However the March 2017 report has now been confirmed as a complete hoax and just the latest in a string of fake celebrity death reports. Thankfully, the host of The View is alive and well.  UPDATE 09/03/2017 : This story seems to be false. (read more)  Rumors of the actresss alleged demise gained traction on Tuesday after a R.I.P. Sherri Shepherd Facebook page attracted nearly one million of likes. Those who read the About page were given a believable account of the American actresss passing:  Hundreds of fans immediately started writing their messages of condolence on the Facebook page, expressing their sadness that the talented 49-year-old actress, comedienne and television host was dead. And as usual, Twittersphere was frenzied over the death hoax.  Where as some trusting fans believed the post, others were immediately skeptical of the report, perhaps learning their lesson from the huge amount of fake death reports emerging about celebrities over recent months. Some pointed out that the news had not been carried on any major American network, indicating that it was a fake report, as the death of an actress of Sherri Shepherd's stature would be major news across networks.  A recent poll conducted for the Celebrity Post shows that a large majority (91%) of respondents think those Sherri Shepherd death rumors are not funny anymore.  Sherri Shepherd Death Hoax Dismissed Since Actress Is Alive And Well  On Wednesday (March 08) the actress' reps officially confirmed that Sherri Shepherd is not dead. She joins the long list of celebrities who have been victimized by this hoax. She's still alive and well, stop believing what you see on the Internet, they said.  Some fans have expressed anger at the fake report saying it was reckless, distressing and hurtful to fans of the much loved actress. Others say this shows her extreme popularity across the globe.   2017 MediaMass All rights reserved. Do not reproduce (even with permission).";hoax

To promote the new soft-serve store, founder Sherb Noble suggested an \"all you can eat for 10 cents\" sale. The promotion was so popular, Noble worried that the stampede of customers would break the glass windows of the store front.  A \"brazier,\" by the way, is another word for a charcoal grill.  The original store was deemed \"Dairy Queen\" because Jack \"Grandpa\" McCullough, the \"driving force\" behind DQs soft serve, said his creation was a queen among dairy products.  And just like KFC and Coke, they'll never reveal the ingredients. \"[The formula] is kept in a safe deposit box and there are only a few keys to it,\" DQ's chief branding officer, Michael Keller, has said.  Gwen Stefani and her brother Eric worked with other founding member John Spence at an Anaheim store, where they discussed forming a band.Other celebrity DQ employees include former Attorney General John Ashcroft, actress Bonnie Hunt, and singer Martina McBride.  Theysold more than 175 million Blizzards in the very first year.  Its proof of how thick and delicious their soft-serve isbut its also a total marketing gimmick. Some stores offer the treat for free if the employee fails to perform the trick.  In the U.S., the most popular Blizzard is Oreo.  Of course, he owns itat least, Berkshire Hathaway doesbut he really supports the product. Once, while dining at the Four Seasons in New York, he asked staff to pick him up some DQ ice cream for dessert. Unfortunately, the city didnt have a DQ location at the time, so he had to settle for some cookies.  You may remember the Breeze, a lower-calorie Blizzard alternative that was made with frozen yogurt. It was around for about a decade before the company pulled it from the menu, saying demand was so low that the frozen yogurt would often go bad before it could be used.  Cuban suggested that Ed Rush, the NBAs head of officiating, wasnt even capable of managing a Dairy Queen. In response, the company invited the billionaire to give it a shot himselfand he accepted their offer. Wearing a \"Tony\" nametag, Cuban spent two hours serving customers at a Dairy Queen in Coppell, Texas, in 2002. He had trouble perfecting the trademark Q swirl at the top of soft-serve cones.  According to the company, \"Our soft-serve does not qualify to be called ice cream. To be categorized as ice cream, the minimum butterfat content must be 10 percent, and our soft-serve has only 5 percent butterfat.\"  The soft-serve round coated in chocolate and finished with that signature Dairy Queen swirl was introduced to the franchise by Robert Litherland, the co-owner of a store in Moorhead, Minn. Employees of an ice cream distributor in Minneapolis showed up at Litherlands door to demonstrate the technique, and finished by holding up the completed bar and saying, Now, isnt that a dilly! The name stuck, though Litherland had one regret: \"We werent smart enough to copyright that name.\"  When DQ rolled out the MooLatte frozen coffee drink in 2004, more than a few eyebrows were raised at the made-up words similarity to the slur \"mulatto.\" The controversy wasnt enough to squash the product; its still around today.  When the copyright license expired, Dairy Queen chose not to renew it. Its been speculated that company execs felt Dennis was no longer a character kids related to.  Clad in a Dutch-style cap, dress, and shoes, Little Miss Dairy Queen was featured as a 5-foot weather vane in a select few locations.

Made of sponge cake and vanilla ice cream, the dessert was constructed in Toronto in 2011. It weighed more than 10 tons and was topped with a ridiculous amount of crushed Oreo cookies.  It must, anywayotherwise, Berkshire Hathaway wouldnt have opened the worlds largest Dairy Queen in Riyadh. The two-level restaurant is 7500 square feet and can seat 240 customers.  To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Blizzard in 2010, DQ took a cue from Oscar Mayer and rolled out the Blizzardmobile, a large truck that stopped at 25 cities in the U.S. and Canada.

Although President Donald Trump would certainly take satisfaction in the news, there is no truth to reports that the media giant declined to renew the news networks contract.  Not that long ago, Trump launched an extraordinary denunciation of his critics, complaining he inherited a mess and slamming stories that his campaign was constantly in contact with Russia as fake news. Trump has an ongoing feud with CNN about their reporting.  I have never seen more dishonest media, frankly than the political media, Trump said, later slamming leaks to the press from the intelligence community  some of which led to the resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn. The leaks are real. The leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake, Trump said.  Where did this fake news originate?

CNN released in a comment in response saying that they are grateful for the many years that they have worked with Time Warner, but will now look to the future. With Time Warner dumping CNN its likely only a matter of time before other major companies follow suit.  The fake news article suggested that Time Warner released a statement about their decision, However, there is no such release available on the companys web site to support that claim. Furthermore, no such statements can be found on the web site of the Turner Broadcasting System, which is the division of Time Warner that owns CNN.

model;"Tommy Chong Death";"Tommy Chong Death";"Tommy Chong is not dead, so everyone worried about the rumors spreading across the internet can just mellow out a bit.  The story has spread across the internet this week in a few different variants, with one saying the 77-year-old comedian and marijuana aficionado had died of cancer and another claiming that he took his own life. The stories made the rounds on Facebook and Twitter, gaining a mix of shock and sadness from his fans.  As the Gamers Drop noted, the headline on the Facebook post claimed that he died early on Wednesday morning, but the report itself was actually much older.  This makes Tommy Chong one of a growing number of celebrities to find themselves victims of a death hoax. These stories have increased in frequency in the last few years as people creating the hoaxes try to drive traffic to their websites or trick readers into sharing personal information in order to read the story.  That is the case with another death hoax making the rounds this week, one claiming that actor Brad Pitt had taken his life in the wake of his divorce from Angelina Jolie. The story circulated on Facebook and required readers to give the website access to their personal Facebook info, before directing them to a crudely written story claiming that Pitt shot himself at a shooting range.  Although the story claiming that Tommy Chong is dead had some obvious holes, it still struck home for many fans who have been following the comedians health struggles. Chong, part of the comedy duo Cheech and Chong, announced earlier this year that his rectal cancer had returned. The cancer is believed to be treatable, but it is now the second time in the last five years that he has battled cancer.  Chong announced that he would be undergoing chemotherapy and radiation starting in the summer, and he would also be using marijuana to help ease the side effects of the treatment.  The chemo and radiation were prescribed by the comedians doctors. The marijuana part was Chongs idea.  I dont tell them I smoke, we dont talk about that. Thats a no-no, Chong said in an interview with ABC News. But as far as the treating it with suppositories and that, theyre all for it.  Chong went on to say that marijuana was a big help going through an otherwise draining and intensive treatment.  The main thing about pot is it affects your mental state, he told ABC News. Instead of moaning and groaning about what you have, you start listening to music and reading books, and you get very creative.It takes the brain off, The glass is half-empty, and puts it on The glass is half-full.'  Tommy Chong had already gone through one cancer battle with the help of marijuana, using alternative therapy again after his 2012 diagnosis of early stage prostate cancer.  Although there were plenty of signs indicating that the story about Tommy Chong being dead was false, it still managed to fool a number of people who have shared memories and condolences on social media.  But Chong himself is trying to put a stop to it, tweeting, Im not dead but I just smoked a killer joint.";hoax

At about 11 p.m. ET on Thursday (December 17, 2015), our beloved actor Tommy Chong passed away. Tommy Chong was born on May 24, 1938 in Edmonton. He will be missed but not forgotten. Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page.  However, that account was a hoax as the comedian is still doing well. The clickbait Viral Time Lapse was then published again in March 2016, in August 2016, and again in February 2017. The comedian remains alive and well, however, despite these repeated false stories.  Here are some examples of people sharing the death hoax on social media in the past.  In addition to the fact that death announcements are rarely accompanied by crass requests to Like a Facebook page, reports of Chongs death are dubious given that he is still tweeting on social media and making reference to events that occurred after his supposed passing:  It would certainly be a challenge to be dead and sharing pictures of you on social media.  While the story about Chongs death is obviously fake, it is true that the actor was diagnosed with rectal cancer in and that he underwent an operation in 2015 to deal with it.  Cheech & Chong, while a very successful comedy act, split in 1985 due to creative differences and Cheech Marins desire to focus on a mainstream acting career. This began a difficult time for Chong. He did not act regularly until filling the recurring role (later a regular role) as the fun-loving, aging hippie Leo (similar to his Chong character) on That 70s Show. Chong was absent during the fifth and sixth seasons of the show as he was serving a brief jail sentence; upon his release, he returned to the series for its final two seasons. He also played a role as a hippie in Dharma and Greg.  What did you think of the death hoax? Did you see people falsely sharing it on social media? Let us know in the comments section.";hoax

And as usual, Twittersphere was frenzied over the death hoax.  Where as some trusting fans believed the post, others were immediately skeptical of the report, perhaps learning their lesson from the huge amount of fake death reports emerging about celebrities over recent months. Some pointed out that the news had not been carried on any major Canadian network, indicating that it was a fake report, as the death of an actor of Tommy Chong's stature would be major news across networks.  A recent poll conducted for the Celebrity Post shows that a large majority (70%) of respondents think those Tommy Chong death rumors are not funny anymore.  Tommy Chong Death Hoax Dismissed Since Actor Is Alive And Well  On Wednesday (March 08) the actor's reps officially confirmed that Tommy Chong is not dead. He joins the long list of celebrities who have been victimized by this hoax. He's still alive and well, stop believing what you see on the Internet, they said.  Some fans have expressed anger at the fake report saying it was reckless, distressing and hurtful to fans of the much loved actor. Others say this shows his extreme popularity across the globe.   2017 MediaMass All rights reserved. Do not reproduce (even with permission).";hoax

He was reportedly taken to Bakersfield hospital  about an hour away from the jail.  According to the LA Times, a source said Manson was seriously ill. But they did not provide any further information.  Manson, who was a menace to society on the outside, has reportedly been an unrepentant and incorrigible inmate while serving his sentence.  The LA Times reported the murderer was repeatedly cited for behavioural problems, including hiding mobiles and a hacksaw in his cell.  Its also alleged he was cited for assault, repeated use of a weapon, threatening staff and possessing a mobile.  He was convicted for masterminding the August 1969 murders of seven people, including pregnant actress Sharon Tate, and two other people on separate occasions.

The Hollywood A-lister hasdonatedat least $2,700 to her campaign and he has also supported past presidential campaigns forJohn KerryandBarack Obama.  DiCaprio also had glowing words to say about Clinton's Democratic presidential rival,Bernie Sanders, especially for his environmental bonafides.  \"Look, not to get political, but listening to Bernie Sanders at that first presidential debate was pretty inspiringto hear what he said about the environment,\" DiCaprio toldWiredin December. \"Who knows which candidate is going to become our next president, but we need to create a dialogue about it. I mean, when they asked each of the candidates what the most important issue facing our planet is, Bernie Sanders simply said climate change.

This in turn made him support the Democrats every single election.  Given this fact, if DiCaprio were to choose a candidate right this instant, his choice would be Hillary Clinton and not Trump. While Clinton calls climate change an urgent threat and a defining challenge of our time, Trumps position on the subject have been largely mixed.  Afinal nail in the coffin for DiCaprios alleged support for Trump, he was set to host a fundraiser for Clinton. He later bowed out of the event however, stating conflicts in his schedule as the reason.

Long shot GOP candidate John Kasich, meanwhile, has stated he believes in the concept of climate change but is not sure of the science behind it.  Both Democratic candidates have taken extreme positions on the issue.  Hillary Clinton recently linked climate change to the Syrian refugee crisis, while Sen. Bernie Sanders previously stated, climate change is directly related to the rise of global terrorism.  Attorney General Loretta Lynch stated earlier this month the U.S. Department of Justice has been considering whether people should be prosecuted for denying climate change, despite the fact that the issue is far from settled.  At last months Oscars, after winning his first Academy Award, Leonardo DiCaprio used his acceptance speech to ask for international support in stopping the worlds big polluters.  Climate change is real. It is happening right now, said DiCaprio. It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species, and we need to work collectively together and stop procrastinating.  In 2014, the Environmental Policy Alliance mocked Leonardo DiCaprio for being just another celebrity hypocrite, calling out the star for traveling around the world in super yachts and private jets and wasting thousands of gallons of jet fuel to indulge his lavish tastes.  The group also called out the actor for owning five homes.  ";unknown

But who cares?  With the exception of Oprah Winfreybacking Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary, celebrity endorsements have never been proven to have moved many voters in past elections.  And, despitethis being the most unprecedented presidential campaign in American history, thetraditional \"celebgap\"  Democrats typically boastHollywood endorsements in better quantity and qualitythan Republicansremainsobvious,albeit more gapingthan ever before.  But so far in 2016,it hasn't mattered, maybe becausethe candidates, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, are major celebs themselves.  So why do candidates still chase celebrity endorsements? Because such big names can help with fundraising and because they might influence certain voting blocks, such as Millennials glued to their social mediaaccounts, say political and pop-culture experts.  \"If a celebrity they look up to is online slamming a candidate, that's going to leavean impression,\" says Bre Payton, 24, who covers culture and Millennial politics for the conservative/libertarianmagazineThe Federalist. \"WhenChrissy Teigen gets into Twitter fights with Trump, pointing out how ridiculous his ideas are, that definitelyleaves an impression on young voters; they may not be so likely to vote for someone as a result.\"  Trump, the most famous Hollywoodentertainer-turned-presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan in 1980, could plausibly boasthe's a bigger starthan any celeb who might endorse him.  The few who have endorsed Trump mostly inhabit the C- list: rocker Ted Nugent, wrestler Hulk Hogan, Duck Dynasty's Phil Robertson, Vegas crooner Wayne Newton. They tend to get more attention for their Trump love than arguably bigger stars like country queen Loretta Lynn, Cheers star Kirstie Alley and Oscar winner Jon Voight.  Trump \"doesnt need anybody, and why would he? He's the most egotistical candidate we've ever seen, why would he want anybody showing him up?\" says David Schneiderman, a founder/owner of Hollywood trailer-maker Seismic Productions and a fundraiser for Clinton.  Meanwhile, DemocratClinton, one of the most famous women in the world, boasts Katy Perry, Reese Witherspoon and Lena Dunham among her supporters..  Tuesday, Leonardo DiCaprio was to co-host a starry fundraiser for Clinton in Los Angeles but had to bowout due to aschedule change.ButJustin Timberlake and wife Jessica Biel will fill in for him, along with other Hollywood co-hosts, including Jennifer Aniston, Tobey Maguire and Shonda Rhimes.  And yet, according to polls, Clinton remainsone ofthe most distrusted and dislikedDemocratic presidential nominees in years.A Washington Post/ABC pollAug. 1-4found that 50% of those polled had anunfavorable view of her (compared with a63% unfavorability rating for Trump), while 59% do not consider her honest and trustworthy (compared with 62% for Trump).  Trump's main A-list endorsement so far isClint Eastwood  a surprisingly tepid Eastwood.The Oscar-winning actor and director said in an interview withEsquirethis month that if he had to pick between Clinton and Trump, Id have to go for Trump.\"  Talk about damning with faint praise.But why should Trumpcare?He's gotten this far without the A-list.  Trump promised a showbiz-style Republican National Convention last month, but it wasn't. The two big celebs on hisstage were Scott Baio, a sitcom actor who hasn't been on TV in decades, and soap actor Antonio Sabato Jr., betterknown as a former underwear model.  The Democratic National Convention had celebs to spare: Perry sang. Elizabeth Banks mocked. Dunham and America Ferrera declared Trump is\"making America hate again.\" Meryl Streep dressed in a Stars-and-Stripes dress and let out a primal scream for Clinton. Bernie Sanders arrivedwith a strong and passionate stable of A-list endorsers but, by the end, led by comedianand Sanders supporter Sarah Silverman, most of them were embracing Clinton.  \"Trumpembarrassed himself with the level of celebs,\" says veteran Hollywood publicist Howard Bragman,founder of Fifteen Minutes PR. \"The Democrats' convention, you could have watched it as a variety show.\"  As everyone knows, Hollywood leans liberal Democrat, so Trump's lack of celebrity luster (other than his own) isn't surprising, says journalism professor Mark Feldstein of the University ofMaryland. Trump's problem is that the more he campaigns and the more he talks, the less likely he is to acquire Hollywood fans, Feldstein says.  \"Trump has become such a stigma, he doesnt even have the support of a traditional GOP candidate,\" Feldstein says. \"Clinton isn't coolbut Trump is so radioactive in most of Hollywood, by default she gets the support of a traditional liberal bastion, if she keeps her head.\"  Besides, she's been working Hollywood for decades. What makes Trump's campaign different is that he isn't trying that hard. And he says he doesn't need to raise money from Hollywood donors.  \"Trump is not trying to cultivate celebritiesto be at his side,\" says presidential historian Douglas Brinkley of Rice University in Texas.\"He is the top of the celebrity food chain, he doesnt need an entourage. He's able to carry that mountain himself, particularly on Twitter, where hes in command of his brand every day.\"  Trump haseven discouraged some of his boldfacedfriendsTom Brady, for instance from publiclyendorsing him in case it interferes with their careers or commercial affiliations.  \"If Trump is already playing this like his celebrity-based reality program, doesn't whoever he brings out end up being redundant?\" asks Robert Thompson, a professor and director of theBleier Center for Television & Popular Cultureat Syracuse University. \"Why does he needstar power whenhe presented this (campaign)as a one-man show?\"  Thompson saysmost votersfeel strongly about their political leanings; it's part of their identity andmore powerful than how they may feel about a popular celebrity.  \"You're not going to go over to the other side just because you like Clint Eastwood so much,\" Thompson says.  Looked at scientifically, the value of celeb endorsements is usually more ephemeral than factual, with one recent exception: the Oprah-for-Obama endorsement during the 2007-08 primary campaign against Clinton. According to CraigGarthwaite, who co-wrote astudyof the endorsementwhen he was at the University of Maryland (he's now anassistant professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University), Winfrey was responsible for moving about 1 million votes to Obama in his quest for the Democratic nomination. (This year, WinfreyendorsedClinton.)  Garthwaite says his research showed Winfreywas effective because she was a celebrity of \"nearly unparalleled popularity\" at the time whoinfluenced her fan base(white women) to vote for Obama over a white female candidate with similar policy positions. Winfreyincreased Obama's share of the vote in the primary, increased his campaign donations and increased overall voter participation, he says.  \"I would be surprised if celebrity endorsements were afactor (in 2016) because we dont have celebrities (likeOprah)with 8 million tuning in to a daily talk show and a provenability to move products, and because the mediais more fragmented now,\" Garthwaite says.  The real value of a celeb endorsement these days may be financial, if the celeb is seen as politically savvy and authentic, says Schneiderman.  \"We live in a celebrity culture and knowing that a celebrity is attached or on board helps with raising money,\" he says. \"But it has to be the right celebrity.People like LeonardoDiCaprio is a perfect example: Heputs hismoney where his mouth is, he researches causes, he has organizations he's created. GeorgeClooney is another. They're notjust looking for fame, they're literally working on issues.\"";unrelated

Islam is one of the smallest minority faiths in Japan, having more adherents in the country than the Bah' faith, but fewer than Christianity. There were isolated occasions of Muslims in Japan before the 19th century. Japan's Muslim population is around 70,000 which includes less than 10,000 of them as Japanese and the rest being foreigners (Majority of them are nationals from Southeast Asian countries).[1]  There are isolated records of contact between Islam and Japan before the opening of the country in 1853, possibly as early as the 1700s; some Muslims did arrive in earlier centuries, although these were isolated incidents.  The earliest Western records of Japan can be found in the works of the Muslim cartographer Ibn Khordadbeh, who clearly mentions Japan as the \"lands of Waqwaq\" twice: East of China are the lands of Waqwaq, which are so rich in gold that the inhabitants make the chains for their dogs and the collars for their monkeys of this metal. They manufacture tunics woven with gold. Excellent ebony wood is found there. And: Gold and ebony are exported from Waqwaq.[2] Mahmud Kashgari's 11th century atlas indicates the land routes of the Silk Road and Japan in the map's easternmost extent.  Within Kublai's court, his most trusted governors and advisers appointed by meritocracy with the essence of multiculturalism were: Semu, Hui, Koreans and Chinese.[3][4] Because the Wokou extended support to the crumbling Song dynasty, Kublai Khan initiated the Mongol invasions of Japan.  The court of the Goryeo supplied Korean troops and an ocean-going naval force for the Mongol campaigns. Despite the opposition of some of his Confucian-trained advisers, Kublai decided to invade Japan, Burma, Vietnam, and Java, following the suggestions of some of his Mongol officials. He also attempted to subjugate peripheral lands such as Sakhalin, where its indigenous people eventually submitted to the Mongols by 1308, after Kublai's death.  During the 14th century, Hongwu Emperor of the Ming dynasty made Ryukyu Kingdom a tributary vassal, and ethnic Chinese settlers consolidated the islands for their ruler in Nanjing.  During that period there was contact between the Hui, general Lan Yu of the Ming dynasty and the swordsmiths of Japan. According to Chinese sources, Lan Yu owned 10,000 Katana, Hongwu Emperor was displeased with the general's links with Kyoto and more than 15,000 people were implicated for alleged treason and executed.[5][6]  Early European accounts of Muslims and their contacts with Japan were maintained by Portuguese sailors who mention a passenger aboard their ship, an Arab who had preached Islam to the people of Japan. He had sailed to the islands in Malacca in 1555.[7][8]  The first modern[clarification needed] Muslim contacts[clarification needed] were with Indonesians who served aboard British and Dutch ships in the late 19th century.[citation needed]  In the late 1870s, the biography of Muhammad was translated into Japanese. This helped Islam spread and reach the Japanese people, but only as a part of the history of cultures.[citation needed]  Another important contact was made in 1890 when the Ottoman Empire dispatched a naval vessel to Japan for the purpose of saluting the visit of Japanese Prince Komatsu Akihito to Constantinople several years earlier. This frigate was called the Ertugrul, and was destroyed in a storm along the coast of Wakayama Prefecture on September 16, 1890.[citation needed]  The first Japanese to go on the Hajj was Kotaro Yamaoka. He converted to Islam in 1909 in Bombay, after coming into contact with Russian-born writer, Abdrreid brahim, whereupon he took the name Omar Yamaoka. Both were traveling with the support of nationalistic Japanese groups like the Black Dragon Society (Kokurykai), Yamaoka in fact had been with the intelligence service in Manchuria since the Russo-Japanese war. His official reason for travelling was to seek the Sultan's approval for building a mosque in Tokyo. This approval was granted in 1910, and the mosque was completed in 1938. Another early Japanese convert was Bunpachiro Ariga, who about the same time went to India for trading purposes and converted to Islam under the influence of local Muslims there, and subsequently took the name Ahmed Ariga. Yamada Toajiro was from 1892 for almost twenty years the only resident Japanese trader in Constantinople.[9] During this time he served unofficially as consul. He converted to Islam, and took the name Abdul Khalil, and made a pilgrimage to Mecca on his way home.  The real Muslim community life however did not start until the arrival of several hundred Turko-Tatar Muslim refugees from Central Asia and Russia in the wake of the October Revolution. These Muslims, who were given asylum in Japan, settled in several main cities and formed small communities. They are estimated at less than 600 in 1938 for Japan proper, a few thousand on the continent. Some Japanese converted to Islam through contact with these Muslims.  The Kobe Mosque was built in 1935 with the support of the Turko-Tatar community of traders there. The Tokyo Mosque, planned since 1908 was finally completed in 1938, with generous financial support from the zaibatsu. Its first imams were Abdrreid brahim (18571944), who had returned in 1938, and Abdulhay Qorbangali (18891972).  The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community was established in 1935 in Japan.[10]  In the late Meiji period, close relations were forged between Japanese military elites with an Asianist agenda and Muslims to find a common cause with those suffering under the yoke of Western hegemony.[11] In 1906, widespread campaigns were aimed at Muslims nations with journals reporting that a Congress of religions was to be held in Japan where the Japanese would seriously consider adopting Islam as the national religion and that the Emperor was at the point of becoming a Muslim.[12]  Nationalistic organizations like the Ajia Gikai were instrumental in petitioning the Japanese government on matters such as officially recognizing Islam, along with Shintoism, Christianity and Buddhism as a religion in Japan, and in providing funding and training to Muslim resistance movements in Southeast Asia, such as the Hizbullah, a resistance group funded by Japan in the Dutch Indies. The Greater Japan Muslim League (, Dai Nihon Kaiky Kykai?) founded in 1930, was the first official Islamic organisation in Japan. It had the support of imperialistic circles during World War II, and caused an \"Islamic Studies Boom\".[13] During this period, over 100 books and journals on Islam were published in Japan. While these organizations had their primary aim in intellectually equipping Japan's forces and intellectuals with better knowledge and understanding of the Islamic world, dismissing them as mere attempts to further Japan's aims for a \"Greater Asia\" does not reflect the nature of depth of these studies. Japanese and Muslim academia in their common aims of defeating Western colonialism had been forging ties since the early twentieth century, and with the destruction of the last remaining Muslim power, the Ottoman Empire, the advent of hostilities in World War II and the possibility of the same fate awaiting Japan, these academic and political exchanges and the alliances created reached a head. Therefore, they were extremely active in forging links with academia and Muslim leaders and revolutionaries, many of whom were invited to Japan.  Shmei kawa, by far the highest-placed and most prominent figure in both Japanese government and academia in the matter of Japanese-Islamic exchange and studies, managed to complete his translation of the Qur'an in prison, while being prosecuted as an alleged class-A war criminal by the victorious Allied forces for being an 'organ of propaganda'.[14] Charges were dropped for his erratic behaviour officially; however historians have speculated that the weakness of the charges against him was more likely the true reason. While Okawa did display unusual behaviour during the trial such as rapping on the head of Hideki Tj, he also stated that the trial was a farce and unworthy of being called one.[citation needed] He was transferred to a hospital on official claims of mental instability and then prison, and freed not long thereafter, dying a Muslim in 1957 after a quiet life where he continued lecturing, on his return to his home village and his wife, who survived him. He claimed to have seen visions of Muhammad in his sleep.[citation needed]  In the 1970s, another \"Islamic Boom\" occurred, this time due to the \"Arab Boom\" after the 1973 oil crisis. After realizing the importance of the Middle East and its massive oil reserves for the Japanese economy, the Japanese mass media have since been giving big publicity to the Muslim World in general and the Arab World in particular.[citation needed]  The Turks have been the biggest Muslim community in Japan until recently.  The Japanese invasion of China and South East Asian regions during the Second World War brought the Japanese in contact with Muslims. Those who converted to Islam through them returned to Japan and established in 1953, the first Japanese Muslim organisation, the Japan Muslim Association under the leadership of Sadiq Imaizumi.  The second president of the association was the Umar Mita, who was typical of the old generation, learning Islam in the territories occupied by the Japanese Empire. He was working for the Manshu Railway Company, which virtually controlled the Japanese territory in the northeastern province of China at that time. Through his contacts with Chinese Muslims, he became a Muslim in Peking. When he returned to Japan after the war, he made the Hajj, the first Japanese in the post-war period to do so. He also made a Japanese translation of the Qur'an from a Muslim perspective for the first time. Aljazeera also made a documentary regarding Islam and Japan called \"Road to Hajj  Japan\".[15]  Though many Islamic organisations were established since the 1900s, each of them had only very few active members.[citation needed]  The Muslim community in Japan has a history of over 100 years, although some sources disagree.[16][17][18] Historian Caeser E. Farah documented that in 1909 Abdul-Rashid Ibrahim was the first Muslim who successfully converted the first ethnic Japanese, and in 1935 Kobe MosqueJapan's first Islamic buildingwas constructed.[16][19] On 12 May 1938, a Mosque was dedicated in Tokyo.[20]  In 1941, one of the chief sponsers of the Tokyo Mosque asserted that the number of Muslims in Japan numbered 600, with just three or four being native Japanese.[20] Some sources state that in 1982 the Muslims numbered 30,000 (half were natives).[16] Some ethnic Japanese women during the economic boom of the 1980s converted when large numbers of immigrants from Asia came and mixed with the local population.[21] Most estimates of the Muslim population have been around 100,000 total.[16][22][23] Islam remains a minority religion in Japan, and there is no evidence as to whether its numbers are increasing. Conversion is more prominent among young ethnic Japanese married women, as claimed by the The Modern Religion as early as the 1990s.[21] The true size of the Muslim population in Japan remains a matter of speculation. Some Muslim organizations and media reports have put the number of Muslims in Japan at up to 100,000. The most serious work on this question has been done by Japanese scholars such as Hiroshi Kojima of the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research and Keiko Sakurai of Waseda University. Their estimates suggest a Muslim population of around 70,000, of which perhaps 90% are resident foreigners and about 10% native Japanese.[17][22]  According to japanfocus.org, as of 2009 there were 30 to 40 single-story mosques in Japan plus another 100 or more apartment rooms set aside for prayers in the absence of more suitable facilities. 90% of these mosques use the 2nd floor for religious activities and the first floor as a halal shop (Imported food; mainly from Indonesia and Malaysia), due to financial problems, as membership is too low to cover up the expenses. most of these Mosques have only a capacity of 30 to 50 people.

model;"Indonesia largest moslem population";"Indonesia largest moslem population";"A report released last week by the Pew Research Center predicting that India will overtake Indonesia as the country with the largest Muslim population has set off the usual suspects. In response, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad on Saturday asked Hindus to have more children to rectify this \"demographic imbalance\" and predicted that soon Muslims will overtake the number of Hindus in India.  This is nothing new, of course. Malthusian fears of a Muslim takeover of India have been a core part of the Hindutva agenda for almost a century now. After the 2002 Gujarat pogrom, for example, Narendra Modi characterised the violence-affected Muslims in riot camps as baby-producing factories.  After he formed the government at the Centre, these fears have come to the fore in the form of pronouncements by various Bharatiya Janata Party leaders who want Hindu women to have greater numbers of children in order to boost the communitys numbers.  In January, just before the Delhi assembly elections, the 2011 Census figures on religion were conveniently leaked to newspapers.  Unfortunately, these feverish demographic projections generate far more heat than light. As the charts below show, actual data on this issue would hardly support the sort of fears that the Sangh Parivar plays up.  This is an extremely popular notion in the Sangh Parivar. Before the Vishwa Hindu Parishad's statement on Saturday, this was last bought up in February by the Bharatiya Janata Partys Sadhvi Prachi, who accused Muslims of giving birth to 40 dogs each and trying to convert Hindustan into Darul Islam.  Drumming up of fears of a minority swamping a majority is standard right wing political strategy and it is no different in India.  Indeed, Muslim population growth rates are higher than the corresponding figure for the Hindu community. If one were to accepted that the leaked figures from the 2011 Census are accurate, Hindus grew at an average annual rate of 1.4% between 2001 and 2011. For Muslims, the corresponding figure was 2.2%.  If we assume both communities continue to grow at this rate, Muslims will catch up with Hindus by 2220  in around 200 years.  Accepting these growth rates, at the time Muslims outnumber Hindus, Indias population will be 3,264 crore. Now you know that is a lot of people but lets see just how much.  At these rates, for Muslims to overtake Hindus, Indias population would need to be almost five times the current global population. In other words, this is clearly an impossible scenario.  More logically, at some point in the future, Muslim growth rates will slow down and the population will stabilise. This, in fact, is already happening. While from 1991 to 2001, the Indian Muslim population grew by 29.3%, in the period 2001-2011, it grew by 24.4%  a fall, therefore, of almost 5 percentage points.  The Sachar Committee Report, taking this falling growth rate into account, has estimated that the Muslim proportion will stabilise at between 17% and 21% of the Indian population by 2100. A far cry from some of the doomsday scenarios being painted.  The extremely poor economic conditions of Muslims in India are cited by many liberals and left wingers as the prime reason for their high population growth rate. However, the Hindutva explanation for this growth, expectedly, blames religious factors and dismisses the economic drivers.  To quote Hindutva Indologist, Koenraad Elst: Muslims will have a markedly higher birth rate than their Hindu counterparts, even to the extent of having a higher birth rate than Hindus in a lower educational or income bracket.  As this chart below shows, depending on how you segment the data, a number of other disadvantaged population groups have growth rates similar to the Muslim growth rate.  Moreover, since Muslim infant mortality is lower than other population segments, this effect can even be seen in the Total Fertility Rate (or number of births per woman).  The Muslim Total Fertility Rate is, as expected, higher than that for Hindus and Christian. But when we segment the population socio-economically, we see that Muslims manage to be better off than people without any education or the poorest fifth of Indias population by wealth.  Clearly then, economic and educational factors seem to the major driver at play here.  We could also disprove the Hindutva groups religious argument by looking at the global scene. Iran, for example, achieved replacement level fertility (with each new generation being less populous than the one before) in 2002, a goal India will only reach in 2020. With a population that is more than 90% Muslim, Bangladesh has a TFR not only lower than Indias overall but also lower than Indias Hindus.  Accusations of large-scale Bangladeshi immigration are a hot-button issue for the right wing now, another supposed driver of the alleged Muslim population boom, along with polygamy (which in itself is untrue). So critical, in fact, that Modi thought that the Assam government was culling rhinos in order to make way for immigrants.  If, as alleged, such large-scale immigration was taking place from Bangladesh to Assam and West Bengal, the Muslim population in those two states would tend to show abnormal growth. But the data shows nothing of that sort.  Assams Muslim population, for example, grew at the same rate as Indias Muslim population between 1991 and 2001 and West Bengals Muslim population, in fact, grew slower. The abnormal growth rate that Assams and West Bengals Muslim populations should show, given the alleged massive Bangladeshi immigration, simply has not happened.  In the rough and tumble of Indias politics, religious rhetoric often goes a long way electorally. It is therefore not surprising that, in spite of the mountains of contrary data, the Sangh Parivar's demographic scaremongering has managed to achieve a significant amount of traction.

Pursuant to the Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security had sixty days to determine whether additional countries or areas of concern should be subject to the travel or dual nationality restrictions under the Act. After careful consideration, and in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence and the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security has determined that Libya, Somalia, and Yemen be included as countries of concern, specifically for individuals who have traveled to these countries since March 1, 2011. At this time, the restriction on Visa Waiver Program travel will not apply to dual nationals of these three countries. DHS continues to consult with the Department of State and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to develop further criteria to determine whether other countries would be added to this list.  The executive order also temporarily banned refugees from all countries for 120 days.  See more coverage of total news hoaxes from the left-wing media at HOAX.news.";unrelated
model;"Indonesia largest moslem population";"Indonesia largest moslem population";"In late November, Indonesian social-media activist Ulin Yusron found himself depicted in a meme. The image, which went viral, falsely portrayed the long-haired male journalist as Amalia Ayuningtyas  a female election volunteer for the governor of Jakarta. The photo, the text claimed, was of Amalia immodestly casting off her usual hijab. It asked: Wheres the Veil??  Jakarta's Christian and ethnically Chinese governor  Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, popularly known as Ahok  is a target for hard-line Muslims, who have successfully pressured the authorities to put him on trial for blasphemy . It is not surprising that memes are being produced that seek to depict the Muslim volunteers in his camp as irreligious and profane.  When I first saw it, I was able to laugh, Ulin tells TIME about the photo collage. But later on, it became so troublesome because there were people who believed it  [The meme] was around for quite a while, and I became tired of explaining it.  Hoaxes like this, and fake news items in general, have become a massive problem in Indonesia in recent months, coinciding with the hotly contested Jakarta gubernatorial election campaign. To be sure, the sharing of fake news on social media has contributed to political tension in many countries  by one estimate, it generated more social-media engagement than real news during the U.S. presidential election in November  but in Indonesia, with its recent incidences of domestic terrorism, and its long and bloody history of anticommunist, anti-Christian and anti-Chinese pogroms, inflaming ethnic and political tensions is potentially deadly.  President Joko Jokowi Widodo, seen as a Muslim moderate, has vowed to crack down, telling a Cabinet meeting that fake news was nothing short of an attempt to destabilize his government. Slander, hatred and rude words on social media are increasingly troubling people, Jokowi tweeted on Dec. 29. We need determined and tough law enforcement.  The problem first drew significant attention during Indonesia's 2014 presidential election, in which Jokowi  Ahok's predecessor as Jakarta's top official  was a candidate. During electioneering, Jokowi was the constant target of a smear campaign that falsely claimed he was, among other things, the child of Indonesian Communist Party members, of Chinese descent, and a Christian. (He was forced to make his marriage certificate public to quell the rumors.)  Now, the creators of fake news are targeting Ahok, who was deputy governor of Indonesia's sprawling capital under Jokowi. Ahok succeeded his boss in the governorship and, backed by Jokowis party, is now seeking his own mandate in the gubernatorial election next year, competing with two other rivals, including former President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's son. Ahok's candidacy is opposed by hard-liners who, insisting that Indonesia's top jobs be filled Muslims only, want to quash any chances Ahok may have of following Jokowi into the national arena.  An edited video and transcript of a campaign speech Ahok made in September, uploaded onto Facebook, went viral and led to ultra-conservative Muslims accusing him of denigrating the Quran. (Ahok suggested in the speech that hard-liners who cited a Quranic verse to support their position that non-Muslims shouldn't hold high office were misleading voters. His exact words were: Ladies and gentlemen, you dont have to vote for me  because youve been lied to by those using [the Qurans] Surah al-Maidah verse 51.)  Three massive demonstrations resulted, bringing tens of thousands of people to the streets of Jakarta, demanding that Ahok be jailed. He was subsequently put in the dock .  Ahok's Chinese ethnicity is the target of much of Indonesia's false news  highly disturbing in a country where tens of thousands of Chinese have lost their lives in pogroms dating back to Dutch colonial rule. There are false rumors of 10 million mainland Chinese workers swamping Indonesia (which Jokowi has rebuffed, saying that 10 million is the number of Chinese tourists we hope will come). Others claim that the design of Indonesias new monetary notes resembles Chinese currency  or that Ahoks free HPV vaccine program could make girls infertile, and is, therefore, part of a Chinese conspiracy to diminish the Indonesian population. Hoaxers also claimed that the commander of the armed forces, General Gatot Nurmantyo, has warned that communist China has started to meddle in this country. Both the Indonesian military and the general have denied he ever made such a statement.  At the same time, Anti-Chinese sentiment isnt independent of its own. It is part of a larger network, says the social-media activist Ulin, who is a supporter of Ahok. He says that fake news is also whipping up anticommunist and anti-Shiite feelings. All of this is to heighten anti-Ahok sentiment while at the same time de-legitimizing Jokowi.  Hoax news has been a daily phenomenon in Indonesia, says Titi Anggraini, executive director of the Association for Elections and Democracy, a Jakarta-based elections watchdog that is also known as Perludem in Indonesian. But, the spread of hoax news intensified during the 2014 presidential election and is intensifying in [the run-up to] the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election.  The government, watchdog groups and even religious organizations have taken steps to stem its spread. The Communications Ministry on Wednesday blocked 11 websites, mostly for spreading hatred and misinformation, following a similar step in November. Fact-check sites, apps and Facebook pages, run by activists and volunteers, have sprung up to set the record straight. Nahdlatul Ulama, the biggest Islamic mass organization in Indonesia, has kicked off an anti-fake-news campaign called #TurnBackHoax, while Muhammadiyah, the second biggest Islamic organization, has declared that spreading hoax news is tantamount to a sin. The Press Council has also said it will be verifying trusted media outlets.  Such actions are important to make things right and to teach a lesson to offenders, Titi tells TIME. But, she adds, The legal process, especially criminal punishment, is really ultimum remidium [the last resort]  and calls for digital literacy education. She also wants guarantees that law enforcement will respect freedom of expression. But that is no easy balance to strike in Indonesia's tense political atmosphere.";hoax

(Not necessarily a criticism, by the way, just different.)  No metric?    While the majority of the civilized world has embraced all things metric, Americans are still dealing in gallons, inches and ounces. Apparently there was a bit of a push for metric in the 1970s; the 1975 Metric Conversion Act declared the metric system the preferred system for trade and commerce. Unfortunately, switching was voluntary and such was the publics aversion that the Metric Conversion Board was disbanded in 1982. You hear some metric measurements bandied about, for example by runners doing 5ks, 10ks and so on, or people buying liter bottles of soda. There is actually a U.S. Metric Association that has existed since 1916, and even an annual National Metric Week (October 5-11). So come on America! If the crusty old U.K. can make the switch, anyone can.  Why dont price tags include the sales tax?    My purse weighs a ton with all the change I never get to hand over because, even if I could calculate the full price of an item, theres never enough time. Heck, even if I did have time, the tax is rarely a handy five or 10 percent. I understand that sales tax is different all over the country (and sometimes non-existent), but so what? If stores can change their prices when they run sales (which arent always national), surely they can let us know how much they really want from us.  Why isnt the World Series a global affair?    Ive heard some cracking answers to this one in my time. Canadian teams play, We would still win if the rest of the world were included and We have the best players in the world playing in the U.S. anyway. The World Baseball Classic is the baseball global event so whats with calling a competition between North American teams the World Series?  If you ask baseball fans, many will say its because the Series was originally sponsored by the New York World newspaper, hence the Worlds Series. Alas, this is an old sporting legend, a fact confirmed by Freddie Berowski, a research associate at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, N.Y. Heres a more detailed history of the evolution of the name.  Why are Jeopardy answers in the form of questions?    It always strikes me as weird that contestants must say what is before giving their answers. Surely, its stressful enough on Jeopardy without having to remember to phrase your answer as a question. A little research, however, unearths the story of the games origin; it was also initially named Whats the Question?, which makes things a little clearer.  Why can U.S. kids drive, vote, get married and die for their country by age 18, yet not buy a six-pack until theyre 21?   It comes as quite the shock to visiting 20-year-olds that they cant go out for a pint here when theyve been doing so in their own country for two years.  The historical explanation is that in 1984 the National Minimum Drinking Age Act was introduced as one of many efforts to curb drink driving. Although it was up to individual states to set MLDAs (minimum legal drinking age), the act witheld federal highway funding from non-compliant states. Not surprisingly, all states eventually raised the age to 21. Heres a great pro-con explanation of the current situation.  Why does everyone on TV shout?

SeeExample(s)  Many believe that the name World Series is American hype or arrogance, but the truth is that the Series was named after the New York World newspaper who sponsored the title games in the early part of the century. I followed the Blue Jays through their futility and then rooted for Atlanta in the wonderful World Series (originally named, by the way, for the New York World, the newspaper that was its first sponsor).  For over a century now, baseballs annual championship, the World Series, has been an essential American ritual. The modern World Series began in 1903, when the National Leagues pennant-winning Pittsburgh Pirates agreed to a best-of-nine playoff series against Boston, champions of the upstart American League (which had made the jump from minor league to major league just two years earlier).  The concept of a post-season championship series evolved long before 1903, however. Teams engaged in exhibitions and unofficial regional playoffs after the end of regular-season play since the earliest days of professional baseball, and after 1882 season the National Leagues first-place Chicago team played a pair of games against Cincinnati, the champions of the newly-formed American Association. These games were primarily exhibition contests (because the National League had yet to acknowledge the legitimacy of the American Association), but every year from 1884 through 1890 the two leagues champions met in post-season series of varying lengths (an event that was known, among other names, as the world series).  The 1891 playoff was cancelled due to interleague squabbling, and any hopes for its resurrection were dashed when the American Association folded before the 1892 season. The National League expanded from eight teams to twelve in 1892 by absorbing four of the entries from the failed American Association, and a post-season championship was created by dividing the season into halves and pitting the winners of the two halves against each other.  The split-season format proved unpopular and therefore didnt come off in 1893, so an entrepreneur from Pittsburgh named Temple promoted a new post-season scheme the next year by offering to award an ornate $800 cup to the winner of a best-of-seven series between the National Leagues first- and second-place finishers. The Temple Cup championship series, as it became known, was held for the four years between 1894 and 1897, after which a lack of fan interest resulted in its termination and the return of the cup to its donor.  Save for a brief series between the National Leagues pennant-winning Brooklyn Superbas and the runner-up Pittsburgh Pirates after the 1900 season (the winner receiving a silver cup donated by the Pittsburgh Chronicle-Telegraph), post-season play did not resume until the modern World Series matching American and National league champions against each other began in 1903.  Somewhere along the way (the earliest citation weve found so far is from 1991), people have picked up the notion that the fall classic, baseballs World Series, is so named not because the victors are considered the worlds champions, but because the contest was originally sponsored by the New York World newspaper. Perhaps this belief springs from todays hyper-commercial sporting climate, in which nearly all athletic championships and sports stadiums are named for corporate sponsors, or perhaps it springs from the incongruity of the winners of a contest featuring only teams from North America being declared world champions, but so prevalent is this erroneous belief that it is now regularly cited as a fact, despite a complete lack of any supporting evidence.  The New York World was established in 1860, just before the Civil War, and it fared poorly throughout the 1870s before being bought up by Joseph Pulitzer in 1883. Over the next half-century, the World was renowned for everything from its yellow journalism to its debut of the crossword puzzle; in 1930 it was sold and merged with the Evening Telegram to become the New York World-Telegram.  The New York World never had anything to do with the World Series, however, other than being one of the many newspapers to report the results. The modern World Series (like its predecessor series waged between National League and American Association teams from 1884-1890) was so named not because of any affiliation with a corporate sponsor, but because the winner was considered the worlds title was therefore simply a shortened form of the phrase worlds championship series.  Negative evidence is easily uncovered by reading accounts of the first few World Series in the major newspapers of the era. The first several contests between the two league champions were reported under a variety of series, world championship series, worlds eventually becoming standardized in name as the World Series. If the name had derived from the New York Worlds sponsorship, it would have been known as nothing but the World Series from the very beginning (and as far back as 1884).  The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum concurs, a 1999 article noting of this claim that:  [O]thers have asked that question of the staff at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. in recent weeks. Theres no evidence suggesting it was ever sponsored by the New York World newspaper, said Hall of Fame researcher Eric Enders. When the World Series between the National and American leagues began in 1903, the owners borrowed the name from the world championship series held in the 1880s between the National League and the American Association. Enders concludes the name didnt originate from the name of the long-defunct newspaper. It sounds like an urban myth.";fact
model;"Baseball's championship competition is known as the World Series because it was originally sponsored by the newspaper.";"Baseball's championship competition is known as the World Series because it was originally sponsored by the newspaper.";"The World Series is the annual championship series of Major League Baseball (MLB) in North America, contested since 1903 between the American League (AL) champion team and the National League (NL) champion team. The winner of the World Series championship is determined through a best-of-seven playoff, and the winning team is awarded the Commissioner's Trophy.[1] As the series is played in October (and occasionally November), during the autumn season in North America, it is often referred to as the Fall Classic.[2]  Prior to 1969, the team with the best regular season win-loss record in each league automatically advanced to the World Series; since then each league has conducted a championship series (ALCS and NLCS) preceding the World Series to determine which teams will advance. As of 2016, the World Series has been contested 112 times, with the AL winning 64 and the NL winning 48.  The 2016 World Series took place between the Cleveland Indians and the Chicago Cubs. Seven games were played, with the Cubs victorious after game seven, played in Cleveland. The final score was 87; the game went into extra innings after a tied score of 66. This was the third World Series won by the Cubs, as well as their first title since 1908, a period of 108 years. With the Cubs' record long title drought finally ended, the Indians' championship dry spell of 68 years and counting  the Tribe last won the Series in 1948 -- is currently the longest-running Series title absence.  In the American League, the New York Yankees have played in 40 World Series and won 27, the Philadelphia/Kansas City/Oakland Athletics have played in 14 and won 9, and the Boston Red Sox have played in 12 and won 8, including the first World Series. In the National League, the St. Louis Cardinals have appeared in 19 and won 11, the New York/San Francisco Giants have played in 20 and won 8, the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers have appeared in 18 and won 6, and the Cincinnati Reds have appeared in 9 and won 5.  As of 2016, no team has won consecutive World Series championships since the New York Yankees in 1998, 1999, and 2000the longest such drought in Major League Baseball history.  Until the formation of the American Association in 1882 as a second major league, the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (18711875) and then the National League (founded 1876) represented the top level of organized baseball in the United States. All championships were awarded to the team with the best record at the end of the season, without a postseason series being played. From 1884 to 1890, the National League and the American Association faced each other in a series of games at the end of the season to determine an overall champion. These series were disorganized in comparison to the modern World Series, with the terms arranged through negotiation of the owners of the championship teams beforehand. The number of games played ranged from as few as three in 1884 (Providence defeated New York three games to zero), to a high of fifteen in 1887 (Detroit beat St. Louis ten games to five). Both the 1885 and 1890 Series ended in ties, each team having won three games with one tie game.[3]  The series was promoted and referred to as \"The Championship of the United States\",[4][5] \"World's Championship Series\", or \"World's Series\" for short. In his book Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded: August 27, 1883, Simon Winchester mentions in passing that the World Series was named for the New York World newspaper,[6] but this view is disputed.[7]  The 19th-century competitions are, however, not officially recognized as part of World Series history by Major League Baseball, as it considers 19th-century baseball to be a prologue to the modern baseball era.[8] Until about 1960, some sources treated the 19th-century Series on an equal basis with the post-19th-century series.[9] After about 1930, however, many authorities list the start of the World Series in 1903 and discuss the earlier contests separately.[10] (For example, the 1929 World Almanac and Book of Facts lists \"Baseball's World Championships 18841928\" in a single table,[11] but the 1943 edition lists \"Baseball World Championships 19031942\".[12])  Following the collapse of the American Association after the 1891 season, the National League was again the only major league. The league championship was awarded in 1892 by a playoff between half-season champions. This scheme was abandoned after one season.[13] Beginning in 1893and continuing until divisional play was introduced in 1969the pennant was awarded to the first-place club in the standings at the end of the season. For four seasons, 18941897, the league champions played the runners-up in the post season championship series called the Temple Cup.[14][15] A second attempt at this format was the Chronicle-Telegraph Cup series, which was played only once, in 1900.[16]  In 1901, the American League was formed as a second major league. No championship series were played in 1901 or 1902 as the National and American Leagues fought each other for business supremacy (in 1902, the top teams instead opted to compete in a football championship).  After two years of bitter competition and player raiding (in 1902, the AL and NL champions even went so far as to challenge each other to a tournament in football after the end of the baseball season), the National and American Leagues made peace and, as part of the accord, several pairs of teams squared off for interleague exhibition games after the 1903 season. These series were arranged by the participating clubs, as the 1880s World's Series matches had been. One of them matched the two pennant winners, Pittsburg Pirates of the NL and Boston Americans (later known as the Red Sox) of the AL; that one is known as the 1903 World Series. It had been arranged well in advance by the two owners, as both teams were league leaders by large margins.[17] Boston upset Pittsburg by five games to three, winning with pitching depth behind Cy Young and Bill Dinneen and with the support of the band of Royal Rooters. The Series brought much civic pride to Boston and proved the new American League could beat the Nationals.[citation needed]  The 1904 Series, if it had been held, would have been between the AL's Boston Americans (Boston Red Sox) and the NL's New York Giants (now the San Francisco Giants). At that point there was no governing body for the World Series nor any requirement that a Series be played. Thus the Giants' owner, John T. Brush, refused to allow his team to participate in such an event, citing the \"inferiority\" of the upstart American League. John McGraw, the Giants' manager, even went so far as to say that his Giants were already \"world champions\" since they were the champions of the \"only real major league\". At the time of the announcement, their new cross-town rivals, the New York Highlanders (now the New York Yankees), were leading the AL, and the prospect of facing the Highlanders did not please Giants management. Boston won on the last day of the season, and the leagues had previously agreed to hold a World's Championship Series in 1904, but it was not binding, and Brush stuck to his original decision. In addition to political reasons, Brush also factually cited the lack of rules under which money would be split, where games would be played, and how they would be operated and staffed.  During the winter of 19041905, however, feeling the sting of press criticism, Brush had a change of heart and proposed what came to be known as the \"Brush Rules\", under which the series were played subsequently. One rule was that player shares would come from a portion of the gate receipts for the first four games only. This was to discourage teams from \"fixing\" early games in order to prolong the series and make more money. Receipts for later games would be split among the two clubs and the National Commission, the governing body for the sport, which was able to cover much of its annual operating expense from World Series revenue. Most importantly, the now-official and compulsory World's Series matches were operated strictly by the National Commission itself, not by the participating clubs.  With the new rules in place and the National Commission in control, McGraw's Giants made it to the 1905 Series, and beat the Philadelphia A's four games to one. The Series was subsequently held annually, until 1994, when it was canceled due to a players' strike.  The list of postseason rules evolved over time. In 1925, Brooklyn owner Charles Ebbets persuaded others to adopt as a permanent rule the 232 pattern used in 1924. Prior to 1924, the pattern had been to alternate by game or to make another arrangement convenient to both clubs. The 232 pattern has been used ever since save for the 1943 and 1945 World Series, which followed a 34 pattern due to World War II travel restrictions; in 1944, the normal pattern was followed because both teams were based in the same home stadium.  Gambling and game-fixing had been a problem in professional baseball from the beginning; star pitcher Jim Devlin was banned for life in 1877, when the National League was just two years old. Baseball's gambling problems came to a head in 1919, when eight players of the Chicago White Sox were alleged to have conspired to throw the 1919 World Series.  The Sox had won the Series in 1917 and were heavy favorites to beat the Cincinnati Reds in 1919, but first baseman Chick Gandil had other plans. Gandil, in collaboration with gambler Joseph \"Sport\" Sullivan, approached his teammates and got six of them to agree to throw the Series: starting pitchers Eddie Cicotte and Lefty Williams, shortstop Swede Risberg, left fielder Shoeless Joe Jackson, center fielder Happy Felsch, and utility infielder Fred McMullin. Third baseman Buck Weaver knew of the fix but declined to participate, hitting .324 for the series from 11 hits and committing no errors in the field. The Sox, who were promised $100,000 for cooperating, proceeded to lose the Series in eight games, pitching poorly, hitting poorly and making many errors. Though he took the money, Jackson insisted to his death that he played to the best of his ability in the series (he was the best hitter in the series, including having hit the series' only home run, but had markedly worse numbers in the games the White Sox lost).  During the Series, writer and humorist Ring Lardner had facetiously called the event the \"World's Serious\". The Series turned out to indeed have serious consequences for the sport. After rumors circulated for nearly a year, the players were suspended in September 1920.  The \"Black Sox\" were acquitted in a criminal conspiracy trial. However, baseball in the meantime had established the office of Commissioner in an effort to protect the game's integrity, and the first commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, banned all of the players involved, including Weaver, for life. The White Sox would not win a World Series again until 2005.  The events of the 1919 Series, segueing into the \"live ball\" era, marked a point in time of change of the fortunes of several teams. The two most prolific World Series winners to date, the New York Yankees and the St. Louis Cardinals, did not win their first championship until the 1920s; and three of the teams that were highly successful prior to 1920 (the Boston Red Sox, Chicago White Sox and the Chicago Cubs) went the rest of the 20th century without another World Series win. The Red Sox and White Sox finally won again in 2004 and 2005, respectively. The Cubs had to wait over a century (until the 2016 season) for their next trophy. They did not appear in the Fall Classic from 1945 until 2016, the longest drought of any MLB club.  The New York Yankees purchased Babe Ruth from the Boston Red Sox after the 1919 season, appeared in their first World Series two years later in 1921, and became frequent participants thereafter. Over a period of 45 years from 1920 to 1964, the Yankees played in 29 World Series championships, winning 20. The team's dynasty reached its apex between 1947 and 1964, when the Yankees reached the World Series 15 times in eighteen years, helped by an agreement with the Kansas City Athletics (after that team moved from Philadelphia during 19541955 offseason) whereby the teams made several deals advantageous to the Yankees (until ended by new Athletics' owner Charles O. Finley). During that span, the Yankees played in all World Series except 1948, 1954, and 1959, winning ten. From 1949 to 1953, the Yankees won the World Series five years in a row; from 19361939 the Yankees won four World Series Championships in a row. There are only two other occasions when a team has won at least three consecutive World Series: 1972 to 1974 by the Oakland Athletics, and 1998 to 2000 by the New York Yankees.  In an 18-year span from 1947 to 1964, except for 1948 and 1959, the World Series was played in New York City, featuring at least one of the three teams located in New York at the time. The Dodgers and Giants moved to California after the 1957 season, leaving the Yankees as the lone team in the city until the Mets were enfranchised in 1962. During this period, other than 1948, 1954, and 1959, the Yankees represented the American League in the World Series.  In the years 1947, 1949, 19511953, and 19551956, both teams in the World Series were from New York, with the Yankees playing against either the Dodgers or Giants.  In 1958, the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants took their long-time rivalry to the west coast, moving to Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively, bringing Major League Baseball west of St. Louis and Kansas City.  The Dodgers were the first of the two clubs to contest a World Series on the west coast, defeating the Chicago White Sox in 1959. The 1962 Giants made the first California World Series appearance of that franchise, losing to the Yankees. The Dodgers made three World Series appearances in the 1960s: a 1963 win over the Yankees, a 1965 win over the Minnesota Twins and a 1966 loss to the Baltimore Orioles.  In 1968, the Kansas City Athletics relocated to Oakland and the following year 1969, the National League granted a franchise to San Diego as the San Diego Padres. The A's became a powerful dynasty, winning three consecutive World Series from 19721974. In 1974, the A's played the Dodgers in the first all-California World Series. The Padres have two World Series appearances (a 1984 loss to the Detroit Tigers, and a 1998 loss to the New York Yankees).  The Dodgers won two more World Series in the 1980s (1981, 1988). The A's again went to three straight world series, from 19881990, winning once. 1988 and 1989 were all-California series as the A's lost to the Dodgers and beat the Giants, respectively. The Giants have been in four World Series' in the new millennium, losing in 2002 to the Anaheim Angels (the most-recent all-California series), and winning in 2010 (Rangers), 2012 (Tigers), and 2014 (Royals).  Prior to 1969, the National League and the American League each crowned its champion (the \"pennant winner\") based on the best win-loss record at the end of the regular season.  A structured playoff series began in 1969, when both the National and American Leagues were reorganized into two divisions each, East and West. The two division winners within each league played each other in a best-of-five League Championship Series to determine who would advance to the World Series. In 1985, the format changed to best-of-seven.  The National League Championship Series (NLCS) and American League Championship Series (ALCS), since the expansion to best-of-seven, are always played in a 232 format: Games 1, 2, 6 and 7 are played in the stadium of the team that has home-field advantage, and Games 3, 4 and 5 are played in the stadium of the team that does not.  MLB night games started being held in 1935 by the Cincinnati Reds, but the World Series remained a strictly daytime event for years thereafter. In the final game of the 1949 World Series, a Series game was finished under lights for the first time. The first scheduled night World Series game was Game 4 of the 1971 World Series at Three Rivers Stadium.[18] Afterward, World Series games were frequently scheduled at night, when television audiences were larger. Game 6 of the 1987 World Series was the last World Series game played in the daytime,[19] indoors at the Metrodome in Minnesota. (The last World Series played outdoors during the day was the final game of the 1984 series in Detroit's Tiger Stadium.)  During this seven-year period, only three teams won the World Series: the Oakland Athletics from 1972 to 1974, Cincinnati Reds in 1975 and 1976, and New York Yankees in 1977 and 1978. This is the only time in World Series history in which three teams have won consecutive series in succession. This period was book-ended by World Championships for the Pittsburgh Pirates, in 1971 and 1979.  However, the Baltimore Orioles made three consecutive World Series appearances: 1969 (losing to the \"amazing\" eight-year-old franchise New York Mets), 1970 (beating the Reds in their first World Series appearance of the decade), and 1971 (losing to the Pittsburgh Pirates, as well their 1979 appearance, when they again lost to the Pirates), and the Los Angeles Dodgers' back-to-back World Series appearances in 1977 and 1978 (both losses to the New York Yankees), as well in 1974 losing against the cross-state rival Oakland Athletics.  Game 6 of the 1975 World Series is regarded by most as one of the greatest World Series games ever played. It found the Boston Red Sox winning in the 12th inning in Fenway Park, defeating the Cincinnati Reds to force a seventh and deciding game. The game is best remembered for its exciting lead changes, nail-biting turns of events, and a game-winning walk-off home run by Carlton Fisk, resulting in a 76 Red Sox victory.  The National and American Leagues operated under essentially identical rules until 1973, when the American League adopted the designated hitter (DH) rule, allowing its teams to use another hitter to bat in place of the (usually) weak-hitting pitcher. The National League did not adopt the DH rule. This presented a problem for the World Series, whose two contestants would now be playing their regular-season games under different rules. From 1973 to 1975, the World Series did not include a DH. Starting in 1976, the World Series allowed for the use of a DH in even-numbered years only. (The Cincinnati Reds swept the 1976 Series in four games, using the same nine-man lineup in each contest. Dan Driessen was the Reds' DH during the series, thereby becoming the National League's first designated hitter.) Finally, in 1986, baseball adopted the current rule in which the DH is used for World Series games played in the AL champion's park but not the NL champion's. Thus, the DH rule's use or non-use can affect the performance of the home team.  The 1984 Detroit Tigers gained distinction as just the third team in major league history (after the 1927 New York Yankees and 1955 Brooklyn Dodgers) to lead a season wire-to-wire, from opening day through their World Series victory.[20] In the process, Tigers skipper Sparky Anderson became the first manager to win a World Series title in both leagues, having previously won in 1975 and 1976 with the Cincinnati Reds.  The 1988 World Series is remembered for the iconic home run by the Los Angeles Dodgers' Kirk Gibson with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning. The Dodgers were huge underdogs against the 104-win Oakland Athletics, who had swept the Boston Red Sox in the ALCS. Baseball's top relief pitcher, Dennis Eckersley, closed out all four games in the ALCS, and he appeared ready to do the same in Game 1 against a Dodgers team trailing 4-3 in the ninth. After getting the first two outs, Eckersley walked Mike Davis of the Dodgers, who were playing without Gibson, their best position player and the NL MVP. Gibson had injured himself in the NLCS and was expected to miss the entire World Series. Yet, despite not being able to walk without a noticeable limp, Gibson surprised all in attendance at Dodger Stadium (and all watching on TV) by pinch-hitting. After two quick strikes and then working the count full, Gibson hit a home run to right, inspiring iconic pronouncements by two legendary broadcasters calling the game, Vin Scully (on TV) and Jack Buck (on radio). On NBC, as Gibson limped around the bases, Scully famously exclaimed, \"the impossible has happened!\" and on radio, Buck equally famously exclaimed, \"I don't believe what I just saw!\" Gibson's home run set the tone for the series, as the Dodgers went on to beat the A's 4 games to 1. The severity of Gibson's injury prevented him from playing in any of the remaining games.  When the 1989 World Series began, it was notable chiefly for being the first ever World Series matchup between the two San Francisco Bay Area teams, the San Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics. Oakland won the first two games at home, and the two teams crossed the bridge to San Francisco to play Game 3 on Tuesday, October 17. ABC's broadcast of Game 3 began at 5pm local time, approximately 30 minutes before the first pitch was scheduled. At 5:04, while broadcasters Al Michaels and Tim McCarver were narrating highlights and the teams were warming up, the Loma Prieta earthquake occurred (having a surface-wave magnitude of 7.1 with an epicenter ten miles (16km) northeast of Santa Cruz, California). The earthquake caused substantial property and economic damage in the Bay Area and killed 63 people. Television viewers saw the video signal deteriorate and heard Michaels say \"I'll tell you what, we're having an earth--\" before the feed from Candlestick Park was lost. Fans filing into the stadium saw Candlestick sway visibly during the quake. Television coverage later resumed, using backup generators, with Michaels becoming a news reporter on the unfolding disaster. Approximately 30 minutes after the earthquake, Commissioner Fay Vincent ordered the game to be postponed. Fans, workers, and the teams evacuated a blacked out (although still sunlit) Candlestick. Game 3 was finally played on October 27, and Oakland won that day and the next to complete a four-game sweep.  World Series games were contested outside of the United States for the first time in 1992, with the Toronto Blue Jays defeating the Atlanta Braves in six games. The World Series returned to Canada in 1993, with the Blue Jays victorious again, this time against the Philadelphia Phillies in six games. No other Series has featured a team from outside of the United States. Toronto is the only expansion team to win successive World Series titles. The 1993 World Series was also notable for being only the second championship concluded by a home run and the first concluded by a come-from-behind homer, after Joe Carter's three-run shot in the bottom of the ninth inning sealed an 86 Toronto win in Game 6. The first Series to end with a homer was the 1960 World Series, when Bill Mazeroski hit a ninth-inning solo shot in Game 7 to win the championship for the Pittsburgh Pirates.  In 1994, each league was restructured into three divisions, with the three division winners and the newly introduced wild card winner advancing to a best-of-five playoff round (the \"division series\"), the National League Division Series (NLDS) and American League Division Series (ALDS). The team with the best league record is matched against the wild card team, unless they are in the same division, in which case, the team with the second-best record plays against the wild card winner. The remaining two division winners are pitted against each other. The winners of the series in the first round advance to the best-of-seven NLCS and ALCS. Due to a players' strike, however, the NLDS and ALDS were not played until 1995. Beginning in 1998, home field advantage was given to the team with the better regular season record, with the exception that the Wild Card team cannot get home-field advantage.  After the boycott of 1904, the World Series was played every year until 1994 despite World War I, the global influenza pandemic of 19181919, the Great Depression of the 1930s, America's involvement in World War II, and even an earthquake in the host cities of the 1989 World Series. A breakdown in collective bargaining led to a strike in August 1994 and the eventual cancellation of the rest of the season, including the playoffs.  As the labor talks began, baseball franchise owners demanded a salary cap in order to limit payrolls, the elimination of salary arbitration, and the right to retain free agent players by matching a competitor's best offer.[citation needed] The Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) refused to agree to limit payrolls, noting that the responsibility for high payrolls lay with those owners who were voluntarily offering contracts. One difficulty in reaching a settlement was the absence of a commissioner.[citation needed] When Fay Vincent was forced to resign in 1992, owners did not replace him, electing instead to make Milwaukee Brewers owner Bud Selig acting commissioner. Thus the commissioner, responsible for ensuring the integrity and protecting the welfare of the game, was an interested party rather than a neutral arbiter, and baseball headed into the 1994 work stoppage without an independent commissioner for the first time since the office was founded in 1920.[citation needed]  The previous collective bargaining agreement expired on December 31, 1993, and baseball began the 1994 season without a new agreement. Owners and players negotiated as the season progressed, but owners refused to give up the idea of a salary cap and players refused to accept one. On August 12, 1994, the players went on strike. After a month passed with no progress in the labor talks, Selig canceled the rest of the 1994 season and the postseason on September 14. The World Series was not played for the first time in 90 years. The Montreal Expos, now the Washington Nationals, were the best team in baseball at the time of the stoppage, with a record of 7440 (since their founding in 1969, the Expos/Nationals have never played in a World Series.)  The labor dispute lasted into the spring of 1995, with owners beginning spring training with replacement players. However, the MLBPA returned to work on April 2, 1995 after a federal judge, future U.S. Supreme Court justice Sonia Sotomayor, ruled that the owners had engaged in unfair labor practices.[citation needed] The season started on April 25 and the 1995 World Series was played as scheduled, with Atlanta beating Cleveland four games to two.  The 2001 World Series was the first World Series to end in November, due to the week-long delay in the regular season after the September 11 attacks. Game 4 had begun on Oct. 31 but went into extra innings and ended early on the morning of Nov. 1, the first time the Series had been played in November. Yankee shortstop Derek Jeter won the game with a 12th inning walk-off home run and was dubbed \"Mr. November\" by elements of the media  echoing the media's designation of Reggie Jackson as \"Mr. October\" for his slugging achievements during the 1977 World Series.  With the 2006 World Series victory by the St. Louis Cardinals, Tony La Russa became the second manager to a win a World Series in both the American and National Leagues.  Prior to 2003, home-field advantage in the World Series alternated from year to year between the NL and AL. After the 2002 Major League Baseball All-Star Game ended in a tie, MLB decided to award home-field advantage in the World Series to the winner of the All-Star Game. Originally implemented as a two-year trial from 2003 to 2004, the practice was extended.  The American League had won every All-Star Game since this change until 2010 and thus enjoyed home-field advantage from 2002, when it also had home-field advantage based on the alternating schedule, through 2009. From 2003 to 2010, the AL and NL had each won the World Series four times, but none of them had gone the full seven games. Since then, the 2011, 2014, and 2016 World Series have gone the full seven games.  This rule is subject to debate, with various writers feeling that home-field advantage should be decided based on the regular season records of the participants, not on an exhibition game played several months earlier.[21][22] Some writers especially questioned the integrity of this rule after the 2014 All-Star Game, when St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright suggested that he intentionally gave Derek Jeter some easy pitches to hit in the New York Yankees' shortstop's final All-Star appearance before he retired at the end of that season.[23][24]  As Bob Ryan of The Boston Globe wrote in July 2015 about the rule:  However, within the last seven seasons, home-field advantage, in terms of deciding World Series games, has not necessarily worked for teams of said games. Since 2014, the home team has not won the deciding game of a World Series.  The San Francisco Giants won the World Series in 2010, 2012, and 2014 while failing to qualify to play in the postseason in the intervening seasons.  The Texas Rangers were twice only one strike away from winning their first World Series title in 2011, but the St. Louis Cardinals scored late twice in Game 6 to force a Game 7.  The Kansas City Royals reached the World Series in 2014, which was their first appearance in the postseason since winning the series in 1985. At the time, it was the longest postseason drought in baseball. They lost in 7 games to the Giants. The following season, the Royals finished with the American League's best record, and won a second consecutive American League pennant. They defeated the New York Mets in the World Series 4-1, capturing their first title in 30 years.  In 2016, the Chicago Cubs ended their 108-year long drought without a World Series title by defeating the Cleveland Indians, rallying from a 31 Series deficit in the process. That extended Cleveland's World Series title drought to 68 years and counting -- the Indians last won the Series in 1948 -- now the longest title drought in the majors.  Beginning in 2017, home field advantage in the World Series will be awarded to the league champion team with the better regular season win-loss record.[26]  American League (AL) teams have won 64 of the 112 World Series played (57%). The New York Yankees have won 27 titles, accounting for 24% of all series played and 42% of the wins by American League teams. The St. Louis Cardinals have won 11 World Series, accounting for 10% of all series played and 23% of the 48 National League victories. At least one New York team has been in 54 World Series (48%) of Series played. When the first modern World Series was played in 1903, there were eight teams in each league. These 16 franchises, all of which are still in existence, have each won at least two World Series titles.  The number of teams was unchanged until 1961, with fourteen \"expansion teams\" joining MLB since then. Twelve have played in a World Series (the Mariners and Expos/Nationals being the two exceptions). The expansion teams have won ten of the 22 Series (45%) in which they have played, which is 9% of all 112 series played since 1903. In 2015, the first World Series featuring only expansion teams was played between the Kansas City Royals and New York Mets.[27]  This information is up to date through the present time:  When two teams share the same state or metropolitan area, fans often develop strong loyalties to one and antipathies towards the other, sometimes building on already-existing rivalries between cities or neighborhoods. Before the introduction of interleague play in 1997, the only opportunity for two teams playing in the same area but in different leagues to face each other in official competition would have been in a World Series.  The first city to host an entire World Series was Chicago in 1906, when the Chicago White Sox beat the Chicago Cubs in six games.  Fourteen \"Subway Series\" have been played entirely within New York City, all including the American League's New York Yankees. Thirteen of them matched the Yankees with either the New York Giants or the Brooklyn Dodgers of the National League. The initial instances occurred in 1921 and 1922, when the Giants beat the Yankees in consecutive World Series that were not technically \"subway series\" since the teams shared the Polo Grounds as their home ballpark. The Yankees finally beat the Giants the following year, their first in their brand-new Yankee Stadium, and won the two teams' three subsequent Fall Classic match-ups in 1936, 1937 and 1951. The Yankees faced Brooklyn seven times in October, winning their first five meetings in 1941, 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1953, before losing to the Dodgers in 1955, Brooklyn's sole World Championship. The last Subway Series involving the original New York ballclubs came in 1956, when the Yankees again beat the Dodgers. The trio was separated in 1958 when the Dodgers and Giants moved to California (although the Yankees subsequently met and beat the now-San Francisco Giants in 1962, and played the now-Los Angeles Dodgers four times, losing to them in a four-game sweep in 1963, beating them back-to-back in 1977 and 1978 and losing to them in 1981). An all-New York Series did not recur until 2000, when the Yankees defeated the New York Mets in five games.  The last World Series played entirely in one ballpark was the 1944 \"Streetcar Series\" between the St. Louis Cardinals and the St. Louis Browns. The Cardinals won in six games, all held in their shared home, Sportsman's Park.  The 1989 World Series, sometimes called the \"Bay Bridge Series\" or the \"BART Series\" (after the connecting transit line), featured the Oakland Athletics and the San Francisco Giants, teams that play just across San Francisco Bay from each other. The series is most remembered for the major earthquake that struck the San Francisco Bay Area just before game 3 was scheduled to begin. The quake caused significant damage to both communities and severed the Bay Bridge that connects them, forcing the postponement of the series. Play resumed ten days later, and the A's swept the Giants in four games (the earthquake disruption of the Series almost completely overshadowed the fact that the 1989 Series represented a resumption after many decades of the October rivalry between the Giants and the A's dating back to the early years of the 20th Century, when the then-New York Giants had defeated the then-Philadelphia Athletics in 1905, and had lost to them in 1911 and again in 1913).  The historic rivalry between Northern and Southern California added to the interest in the Oakland Athletics-Los Angeles Dodgers series in 1974 and 1988 and in the San Francisco Giants' series against the then-Anaheim Angels in 2002.  Other than the St. Louis World Series of 1944, the only postseason tournament held entirely within Missouri was the I-70 Series in 1985 (named for the Interstate Highway connecting the two cities) between the St. Louis Cardinals and the Kansas City Royals, who won at home in the seventh game.  Going into the 2017 season, there has never been an in-state World Series between the teams in Ohio (Cleveland Indians and Cincinnati Reds), Florida (Tampa Bay Rays and Florida Marlins), Texas (Texas Rangers and Houston Astros  who now both play in the American League since the Astros changed leagues in 2013, making any future joint World Series appearance an impossibility unless one of the teams switches leagues), or Pennsylvania (the Philadelphia Phillies and the Pittsburgh Pirates have been traditional National League rivals going back to the late 19th Century). Neither the Phillies nor the Pirates ever faced the Athletics in October during the latter team's tenure in Philadelphia, through 1954. The Boston Red Sox never similarly faced the Braves while the latter team played in Boston through 1952. There also was never an all-Canada World Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and the former Montreal Expos, who never won a National League pennant when they played in that Canadian city from 1969 through 2004. The Expos became the Washington Nationals in 2005  raising the possibility of a potential future \"I-95 World Series\" between the National League team and the AL's Baltimore Orioles, who play just 50 miles to the north of Washington. Finally, the Los Angeles and/or Anaheim Angels have never faced off in October against either the Dodgers or against the San Diego Padres for bragging rights in Southern California, although all three of those teams have appeared in the World Series at various times.  At the time the first modern World Series began in 1903, each league had eight clubs, all of which survive today (although sometimes in a different city or with a new nickname), comprising the \"original sixteen\".  When the World Series was first broadcast on television in 1947, it was only televised to a few surrounding areas via coaxial inter-connected stations: New York City; Philadelphia; Schenectady/Albany, New York; Washington, D.C. and surrounding suburbs/environs. In 1948,[32] games in Boston were only seen in the Northeast. Meanwhile, games in Cleveland were only seen in the Midwest and Pittsburgh. The games were open to all channels with a network affiliation.[33][34] In all, the 1948 World Series was televised to fans in seven Midwestern cities: Cleveland, Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee, St. Louis, and Toledo. By 1949, World Series games could now be seen east of the Mississippi River.[35] The games were open to all channels with a network affiliation.[36] By 1950, World Series games could be seen in most of the country,[37][38][38][39] but not all. 1951 marked the first time that the World Series was televised coast[40] to coast.[32][41][42] Meanwhile, 1955 marked the first time that the World Series was televised in color.[43][44]  ^**:Per the current broadcast agreement, the World Series will be televised by Fox through 2021.[45]    ^***:Gillette,[46] which sponsored World Series telecasts exclusively from roughly 1947 to 1965 (prior to 1966, the Series announcers were chosen by the Gillette Company along with the Commissioner of Baseball and NBC), paid for airtime on DuMont's owned-and-operated Pittsburgh affiliate, WDTV (now KDKA-TV) to air the World Series. In the meantime, Gillette also bought airtime on ABC, CBS, and NBC. More to the point, in some cities, the World Series was broadcast on three different stations at once.    ^****:NBC was originally scheduled to televise the entire 1995 World Series; however, due to the cancellation of the 1994 Series (which had been slated for ABC, who last televised a World Series in 1989), coverage ended up being split between the two networks. Game5 is, to date, the last Major League Baseball game to be telecast by ABC (had there been a Game7, ABC would've televised it). This was the only World Series to be produced under the \"Baseball Network\" umbrella (a revenue sharing joint venture between Major League Baseball, ABC, and NBC). In July 1995, both networks announced that they would be pulling out of what was supposed to be a six-year-long venture. NBC would next cover the 1997 (NBC's first entirely since 1988) and 1999 World Series over the course of a five-year-long contract, in which Fox would cover the World Series in even numbered years (1996, 1998, and 2000).    Despite its name, the World Series remains solely the championship of the major-league baseball teams in the United States and Canada, although MLB, its players, and North American media sometimes informally refer to World Series winners as \"world champions of baseball\".[47]  The United States, Canada, and Mexico (Liga Mxicana de Bisbol, established 1925) were the only professional baseball countries until a few decades into the 20th century. The first Japanese professional baseball efforts began in 1920. The current Japanese leagues date from the late 1940s (after World War II). Various Latin American leagues also formed around that time.  By the 1990s, baseball was played at a highly skilled level in many countries. Reaching North America's high-salary major leagues is the goal of many of the best players around the world, which gives a strong international flavor to the Series. Many talented players from Latin America, the Caribbean, the Pacific Rim, and elsewhere now play in the majors. One notable exception is Cuban citizens, because of the political tensions between the US and Cuba since 1959 (yet a number of Cuba's finest ballplayers have still managed to defect to the United States over the past half-century to play in the American professional leagues). Japanese professional players also have a difficult time coming to the North American leagues. They become free agents only after nine years playing service in the NPB, although their Japanese teams may at any time \"post\" them for bids from MLB teams, which commonly happens at the player's request.  Several tournaments feature teams composed only of players from one country, similar to national teams in other sports. The World Baseball Classic, sponsored by Major League Baseball and sanctioned by the sport's world governing body, the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC), uses a format similar to the FIFA World Cup to promote competition between nations every four years. The WBSC has since added the Premier12, a tournament also involving national teams; the first event was held in 2015, and is planned to be held every four years (in the middle of the World Baseball Classic cycle). The World Baseball Classic is held in March and the Premier12 is held in November, allowing both events to feature top-level players from all nations. The predecessor to the WBSC as the sport's international governing body, the International Baseball Federation, also sponsored a Baseball World Cup to crown a world champion. However, because the World Cup was held during the Northern Hemisphere summer, during the playing season of almost all top-level leagues, its teams did not feature the best talent from each nation. As a result, baseball fans paid little or no attention to the World Cup and generally disregarded its results. The Caribbean Series features competition among the league champions from Mexico, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela but unlike the FIFA Club World Cup, there is no club competition that features champions from all professional leagues across the world.";hoax

While the 1884 post-season championship series was the first such to be referred to as the \"World's Series,\" Major League Baseball considers the 1903 World Series the first.  In 1884, Metropolitans manager Jim Mutrie issued a challenge to his NL counterpart, Frank Bancroft of the Grays. Mutrie's challenge was for a best-of-three series. Each team would put up a thousand dollars with the winner taking the booty.  This pre-modern-era World Series would feature a pitching match-up of future Hall of Famers and 300-game winners Charles \"Old Hoss\" Radbourn and Tim Keefe. That was the year Radbourn won his season-record 59 games (some sources say 60) for the Grays. Keefe was a \"mere\" 3717. Playing under American Association rules, Radbourn and the Grays defeated the New York team in the first two games, 60 and 31.  Only the first game went the full nine innings; the others were called after seven and six, because of darkness and extreme cold, respectively. The third game arguably should never have been played as the format was best-of-three, and Providence clinched in two. It was played with the hope of generating further revenue.  The crowd for the third game comprised only 300 people due to bitter cold. The Gray did not want to play due to the weather but were given the option of choosing the umpire if they would play. The Grays accepted and strategically chose Keefe, the Mets best pitcher. Radbourn, pitching his third complete game in three days, led the Grays to a 122 rout. For the series, Radbourn allowed 11 hits and no earned runs in 22 innings.  Local newspaper The New York Clipper called the series \"The Championship of the United States.\" Several newspapers such as The Sporting Life penned the Grays as \"World Champions\", and the new title stuck.  The total attendance for the three games was 3,800. Despite the low attendance, the two leagues continued the series, and attendance and prize money increased each of the next two years.";unknown

Rick answered: Fred, thank you for your question.     The following information is provided by: funtrivia.    In 1904, Reach Guide reported on the first official \"World Championship Series\", played in 1903, using a name first coined in 1886 by the Spalding(of athletic equipment fame) Baseball Guide, in reference to the post-season game between Chicago and St. Louis.    Spaldings editor noted that since both teams were already \"Champions of the United States\" in their respective leagues, the winner of the post-season games would be \"world\" champions, hence the \"World Championship Series\".    Spalding continued to refer to post-season games by this name, adding that as other nations embraced baseball, their winning teams would participate in the playoffs, turing the \"World's Championship Series\" into a reality.    Although this never happened, the name remained in use, becoming shorter as time passed. This was most evident in the Reach and Spalding Guides, both of which referred, over the years, to the \"World's Series\" and eventually the \"World Series\".    In the 1930's, these guides merged, ceasing publication in 1941, when they were replaced by The Sporting News Guide, who used \"World's Series\" from 1942 through 1963, switching to the \"World Series\" in 1964.

But 30-year-old Texan-born interior designer and Philly resident Jaime Walters hasn't been entirely happy during this much-vaunted \"best coupla weeks for Philly ever\". The reason? She winces every time she hears the Philadelphia Phillies referred to as world champions or champions of the world. Which happens. Often. I know what she means. It's as if every TV and radio station unthinkingly referred to Miley Cyrus as \"the reincarnation of Jimi Hendrix.\" It drives you freaking nuts.  \"They're not world champions,\" says Jaime, who says she watches a hell of a lot of baseball for someone who's not a baseball fan. \"They haven't even played a fair smattering of international teams. They play, what, one Canadian team? I don't want to rob Phillies fans of their victory because it's fantastic, but Americans calling them world champions is arrogant and ignorant - the two often go together, don't they? It's just an extension of American bravado and, right now, this isn't the time for that. This is the time for a little humility.\"  She's right. Which is why this blog is making a direct appeal to president-elect Obama.  Dear Mr President, we - the non-USAian people of the world (and Jaime) know this isn't the most urgent issue you'll face when you take office in January. We know you've got to close Gitmo, end the war in Iraq, put Dick Cheney on trial and save the global economy and that. But this \"world champions\" stuff - it really gets our goat. That roaring sound you hear? That's 6bn foreigners grinding their teeth and groaning. Please make it stop.  You will hear counterarguments. You will be told the reason the NBA, MLB and NFL champs are called world champions is because all the best teams in those sports are USAian.  This is codswallop. England has what is considered by many (well, by the English) to be the world's best soccer league. But its champions would be laughed at if they claimed to be champions of the world.  You will be told that nobody plays baseball to the same level as the USAian teams. But the champions of overwhelmingly British sports like conkers or cheese rolling or bog snorkelling make no claim to be world champions based purely on the assumption that no one conkers, bogsnorkels or cheeserolls quite as well as the Brits. And if these, minor, provincial, globally insignificant little sports were to spread to, say, Japan and a handful of economic colonies, and players from those nations competed in a strictly British teams-only championships, nobody would dream of calling the winners world champions.  To do so would be considered by the rest of the planet to be the very height of unthinking arrogance. And rightly so.  More importantly, the US does have a team that really have been world champions several times - the women's national soccer team. And every time a USAian refers to the winners of a purely national competition as world champions it not only insults these genuine USAian heroines, it diminishes the achievements of all USAians who are real global champions. In short, you're pissing on Michael Phelps' chips, dude. It's not cool.  By lavishing a title on those who haven't earned it, you devalue those who have. It's kinda like when Bill Clinton was called the first black president.  Another similar argument for calling the best NBA/NFL/MLB franchise the world champions is the idea that if there were an international competition, a US national team would win easily. But recent and regular humiliations in international basketball, baseball and women's softball have proven this to be a fallacy.  The one and only time the US national team took part in (an admittedly half-assed) baseball world championship, they lost.  Then there's the argument that because players from 20 other countries play in MLB, this alone legitimises the world champion label. Players from 83 different countries currently play in the Premier League. But this no more makes Manchester United world champions than you being top dog USAian makes you World King Emperor (despite what your predecessor might have thought).  And as for the NFL - no other country plays the sport. No other country ('cept maybe Canada) has a major American football culture. And thus the arguments used in favour of calling, say, the NBA top team world champions fall flat. You can't have it both ways - we're world champs because nobody else plays it AND we're world champs because we've got some players from other countries. Both arguments are utterly specious and entirely contradictory.  Would you not think it absurd and ridiculous if the Australian Rules football champs called themselves world champions? Given than no other nations play the game? And if Australia were the world's dominant economic, cultural and military power - would you not also find it grating, arrogant and offensive? Would you not grimace every time you heard or read it?  On behalf of every non-USAian on the planet, I can tell you that you would.  (Did you know that England are the European Champions of Australian Rules Football, by the way? No, me neither).  One last thing: after an extensive email debate on this topic with a USAian friend (a debate that I won, obviously) she emailed back: \"USA is now World Champ of president electing!\"  In which respect, of course, she is absolutely right.";unrelated

It is not reasonable to host an event called the 'World Series' for a game which is not played outside of America.\" Fans of the sport cried foul! After all, it is common knowledge that the World Series is so named not because the winners are considered the world's champions, but because the competition was originally sponsored by the New York World newspaper; or was it?  The modern World Series began in 1903, when the National League's Pittsburgh Pirates agreed to a playoff series against the Boston Americans (soon the Boston Red Sox) of the American League. The first contests between the two league champions were reported under various titles  \"worlds championship series,\" \"championship series,\" \"world's series,\" and finally, \"World Series.\"  The New York World newspaper was established in 1860, and acquired by Joseph Pulitzer in 1883. It eventually became renowned for its sensationalist tabloid or \"yellow journalism. In the months leading up to the 1903 World's Championship Series there was not a word to suggest any link between the paper and the series.  A spokesman for The National Baseball Hall of Fame has added, \"There's no evidence suggesting it was ever sponsored by the New York World newspaper. Perhaps Mr. Cleese had a point after all.";hoax
model;"Baseball's championship competition is known as the World Series because it was originally sponsored by the newspaper.";"Baseball's championship competition is known as the World Series because it was originally sponsored by the newspaper.";"Major League Baseball is the professional baseball organization in the USA and is made up of two leagues, the American League and the National League. The World Series is the annual championship played between the winner of each league.  Before we go into any great detail about the origin of the title 'World Series', well first look at the different baseball leagues within the United States to get a better understanding of how their system works. The American League is comprised of three divisions, each representing a different geographical area:  The American League West is made up of:  The American League Central is made up of:  The American League East is made up of:  Like the American League, the National League comprises of three divisions, each representing a different geographical area:  The National League West is made up of:  The National League Central is made up of:  The National League East is made up of:  As you can see, both teams contain only teams from the USA (and one from Canada), so why is it called the 'World' Series and where does this name come from?  For many years, it was believed that the name came from the fact that the original series was sponsored by the New York World Telegram newspaper, thus becoming known as the Worlds Series. However, popular as this explanation may be, its not actually true and although the newspaper did report the results of the games, it had nothing to do with the naming of the competition.  The real reason behind the name is thanks to Barney Dreyfuss who was the owner of the Pittsburgh Pirates. In 1903, he wrote to the owner of the Boston Red Sox challenging them to a Worlds Championship Series. The Pirates were the best team in the National League and the Red Sox were the best in the American League.  The games went ahead and Boston won the series five games to three. Over time, the 'Worlds Championship Series' name has been shortened to the World Series and has been played every year apart from 1904 and 1994.  Many Americans consider the World Series as being the world championship of baseball. They base this on the fact that generally the worlds best baseball players play in Major League baseball. This makes it the strongest league in the world consisting of players from over 20 countries.  However, the winners of the World Series arent in any way world champions as this title is reserved for the winners of the World Baseball Classic, which is an international tournament started in 2006. The winning teams of the competitions so far are as follows:  The World Series may only be a North American event but there is no doubt that it is the worlds premier baseball event. Whilst it may not feature teams from across the globe, it does feature many international players. For these reasons, we can justify the World Series as its name.";hoax

Dec. 19: Its official: There will be an eighth season of Shameless.  Showtime has renewed the drama after a pay dispute with leading actress Emmy Rossum. After that was resolved, the program was expected to be renewed without a problem.  Meanwhile, in other programming:  * USA has renewed Shooter for a second season.  Dec. 18: White supremacists have been in the news lately, alas, and it seemed inevitable that someone would make a reality show about them.  And so here we go: A&E has one in the works.  In fact, its had a team embedded with the Klu Klux Klan over the past year, according to Hollywood Reporter, and is readying the reality program Generation KKK for next month.  The show will focus on KKK members whose families want to distance themselves from the organization.  Meanwhile, in other programming:  * Somewhere Between, about a woman who believes her daughter will be murdered, has been ordered straight to series at ABC. It will air this summer.  Dec. 15: CBS wants to make sure Superior Donuts gets off to a superior start.  The network has slated a special sneak preview of the new comedy for Thursday, Feb. 2, at 8:30 p.m., airing behind, yes, The Big Bang Theory, the networks top show in 18-49s.  That should ensure the program gets ample sampling before heading to its regular timeslot the following Monday, airing behind 2 Broke Girls at 9:30 p.m.  The new comedy will replace The Odd Couple, which will finish its abbreviated run next month. The odds of Couple returning are not looking good, as it has struggled this season.  Donuts will preempt The Great Indoors for one week only for the Thursday timeslot. Also that night, new drama Training Day bows in the 10 p.m. slot.  Dec. 14: It appears How I Met Your Father is back in play at 20th TV.  Two and a half years after How I Met Your Mother aired its series finale, the studio is once again eyeing a spinoff of the program, about the circuitous journey of a man meeting the woman he marries.  CBS considered a Father spinoff back in 2014 but ultimately passed on the show from Mother co-creatorsCarter Bays and Craig Thomas.  This time the two are merely producers on the new show, which will be written by This Is Us writersIsaac Aptaker and Elizabeth Berger.  Dec. 13: ABC is loading up on comedies.  The network has ordered one additional episode apiece of Speechless, Fresh Off The Boat, The Middle and American Housewife, bringing their season orders to 23.  And ABC has picked up two additional episodes apiece of black-ish and The Goldbergs, putting them at 24.  The networks comedies have been a bright spot this fall, though several of its dramas, including new ones Notorious and Conviction and second-year program Quantico, have struggled.  Meanwhile, in other programming:  * TV Land has canceled comedy Impastor after two seasons.  * TNT has picked up the nail salon drama Claws.  * TBS has renewed Search Party and People of Earth.  * Netflix has canceled Marco Polo after two seasons.  * IFC has renewed Stan Against Evil for a second year.  Dec. 8:NBC has become the last Big Five network to firm up its midseason lineup, and its got a lot of new shows on it.  The network also has several returning programs.  The bows start Friday, Jan. 6, with Grimm returning for its final season at 8 p.m., followed by new drama Emerald City.  On Thursday, Feb. 2, Powerless takes over the 8:30 slot. Three weeks later, The Blacklist: Redemption, the spinoff of Blacklist, takes over the originals 10 p.m. slot for eight weeks.  The following Monday, The Voice returns for its midseason run, with new drama Taken bowing at 10 p.m.  The latest Chicago-focused Dick Wolf series, Chicago Justice, will join a new Sunday lineup on March 5, leading off with Little Big Shots at 8 p.m. Justice follows at 9 p.m., and Shades of Blue makes its second-season bow at 10 p.m.  New show Trial & Error joins the schedule two nights later at 9:30 p.m. and will run regularly at 9 and 9:30. And on Tuesday, April 25, Great News will take over the 9 p.m. slot.  Meanwhile, in other programming:  * Cinemax has picked up Strike Back for a fifth season.  The CW has canceled the drama, about ayoung Mary, Queen of Scots, after four seasons.  The show will air its upcoming fourth season and then be done.  Thedrama, which is slated to return at midseason, was the networks second-lowest-rated show last season, behind only Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, so the cancellation is not a surprise.  Dec. 5: Luke Cage is getting another season. Celebrity Name Game is not.  Netflix has renewed Cage, the latest in its Marvel series that also includes Daredevil, Jessica Jones and Iron Fist. The series will combine in The Defenders, a fifthseries bowing next year.  This will be the second season for Cage.  Name, meanwhile, is a syndicated game show that has gotten the hook after three seasons. Hosted by Craig Ferguson, the show has had low but steady ratings.  Meanwhile, in other programming:  * CBS has renewed its deal to carry the Kennedy Center Honors through 2025.  * Netflix will bow a Sense8 Christmas special on Dec. 23 and debutseason two on May 5.  Amazon has canceled Good Girls Revolt after one season, despite the show receiving critical acclaim and, evidence suggests, strong viewership.  Like other subscription video on demand services, Amazon does not release viewership numbers.But datafromSymphony Advanced Media suggestGirls was the sites top new show among several just released.  Several reports suggest Amazon passed after deciding the show wasnt a big contender for awards.  Producer Sony Pictures Television will shop the show elsewhere for season two.  Dec. 1: If at first you dont succeed, try a spinoff.  Sons of Anarchy creator Kurt Sutter, whose Bastard Executioner was canceled after one season, is returning to what he does best  biker drama.  FX has greenlit a pilot for Mayans MC, a spinoff of Sons that followsEZ Reyes.  Production on the pilot will begin in March.  Meanwhile, in other programming:  * Showtime has canceled Masters of Sex after four seasons.  * PBS has set its midseason schedule.Sherlock returns on New Years Day, with Mercy Street back on Jan. 22. Call the Midwife comes back April 2. For the full schedule, click here.  The network will patch the hole left by Pure Genius with Training Day, which premieres Thursday, Feb. 2, at 10 p.m.  And Doubt will bow at 10 p.m. on Feb. 15, replacing Code Black, the second-year drama that did not get a full-season order from the network.  The network is getting ambitious on Saturday, slating the scripted drama Ransom. The show will premiere after football on Sunday, Jan. 1, then slide into the 8 p.m. Saturday hour the next weekend.  Survivor will return March 8, while the latest season of The Amazing Race arrives April 21 (it will remain in the Friday 8 p.m. slot).  Nov. 29: CBS is going on a break with The Odd Couple.  The sitcom, which stars Friends' Matthew Perry, will not receive a back-nine pickup this season, though it will finish out its initial 13-episode order.  That doesnt necessarily mean the show is done. Though it has posted low numbers (averaging a 1.0 adults 18-49 rating, down more than 25 percent from last season), it could still have an outside shot of making it to a fourth season.  The show did much better with a stronger lead-in, airing behind The Big Bang Theory and Mom in its first two seasons.  Nov. 28: Quantico was one of ABCs successes last season, but the show has seen big live-viewing declines this fall.  The network is hoping that a new night can help revive the show, and also patch a hole in this falls schedule.  Starting in 2017, Quantico will move from Sundays at 10 to Mondays at 10, replacing Conviction, which is finishing out its initial order but wont receive any more episodes.  Quantico has averaged a 0.8 live-plus-same-day adults 18-49 rating this season, according to Nielsen, down from a 1.2 in its first season.  The show, which more than doubles that L+SD average with DVR viewing added in, will get a much better lead-in from Dancing with the Stars.  Meanwhile, in other programming:  * CBS has lined up a new competition show, Hunted, in which people go on the run and try to avoid capture by professional investigators, that will bow Jan. 22 at 10 p.m., right after the AFC championship game. It will then move to Wednesdays at 8 p.m.  * HBO will premiere Big Little Lies, a new seven-episode limited drama, on Feb. 19 at 9 p.m.  Nov. 22: As Thanksgiving nears, CBS will pass on any more helpings of Pure Genius.  The network is not saying the show is canceled (no one says that anymore) but it has declined to order any more episodes beyond the initial 13.  The show has posted unimpressive numbers on Thursday night, despite airing behind a solid comedy lineup, averaging just a 0.9 adults 18-49 rating.  CBS did pick up full seasons of its five other shows, a good showing by any networks standards.  Genius is set at a hospital where doctors perform miracles by taking chances on unconventional, high-tech treatments.  Nov. 21: The worlds weirdest dinner party is getting a second season.  Martha & Snoops Potluck Dinner Party has been renewed following a solid start to the first season.  The show features Martha Stewart, noted domestic doyenne, and Snoop Dogg, rapper and pot smoker, hosting an eclectic mix of guests each week on VH1.  Nov. 16: This season of Duck Dynasty will be the last.  The Robertsons announced the cancellation as their 11th season began on A&E Wednesday in a video released beforehand.  Once one of the highest-rated programs on cable, Duck has fallen in recent years though its still one of the networks most-watched programs.  Meanwhile, in other programming:  * TBS has renewed Full Frontal with Samantha Bee for a second season. It will move to Wednesdays.  * The CW announced a slew of midseason premiere dates and moves:  DCs Legends of Tomorrow will move to Tuesdays on Jan. 24, airing at 9 p.m. behind The Flash. It will wrap up March 28, and be replaced the following week with iZombie.  Supernatural moves to 8 p.m. Thursday, leading into new drama Riverdale at 9 starting Jan. 26.  Reign is back Friday, Feb. 10, at 9 p.m., following The Vampire Diaries, which will air its series finale March 10. Then The Originals will take its place Fridays at 8 p.m. starting March 17.  The network is not ordering more of No Tomorrow or Frequency: They will end Jan. 17 and 25, respectively.  Nov. 15: ABC, which like Marvel is owned by Disney, is continuing its relationship with the comic book publisher.  The network plans to introduce a new TV series, The Inhumans, next year.  Like Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., it will be set in the comic book universe. But it will launch in theaters rather than on television, bowing next September in IMAX theaters with two episodes.  Eight total episodes will be produced and air on ABC.  Marvel has been busily pursuing TV opportunities to complement its blockbuster movies. In addition to S.H.I.E.L.D. and Marvels Agent Carter (which ABC canceled last spring), the studio also has a slew of shows airing on Netflix and another coming on Hulu.  Meanwhile, in other programming:  * HBO has renewed the first-year programs Divorce, Insecure and Westworld.  Nov. 14: CBS will stick with the new comedies Man With a Plan and The Great Indoors.  The network has given full-season pickups to the new shows, bringing its total number of pickups to five new programs.  Only Pure Genius has failed to earn a full-season order from the network. Plan and Indoors join Bull, Kevin Can Wait and MacGyver.  CBS said it has also ordered three additional episodes of Code Black, its second-year medical show.  ABC has decided the show will fulfill its initial 13-episode order and no more, after posting disappointing numbers in its Monday 10 p.m. timeslot.  The show posted the Big Fours lowest series premiere this fall, drawing a 0.9 adults 18-49 rating, despite airing behind longtime hit Dancing with the Stars.  The network apparently wont outright cancel it, despite the fact that the program dropped to a 0.7 last week.  But it will not produce any more episodes. It already cut its order for another new drama, Notorious.  Nov. 6: Ouch: After just four months, HBO has canceled the new show Any Given Wednesday.  The talk program, hosted by Grantland founder Bill Simmons, debuted amidst great hype in July. HBO grabbed Simmons after ESPN fired him, and it had heavily promoted the show.  But its ratings fell off throughout its run, and HBO apparently didnt see them rebounding.  Simmons released a statement that read in part: We loved making that show, but unfortunately it never resonated with audiences like we hoped. And thats on me.  He still has more than two years left on his deal with the network.  * Comedy Centrals Workaholics will wrap up after the seventh season.  * ABC has picked up three more episodes of The Real ONeals.  The animated show has been renewed for a 29th and 30th season at Fox, which will bring it to 669 episodes. That will shatter the mark for most episodes ever, currently held by Gunsmoke at 635.  Take that Gunsmoke! You lost a race you didnt even know you were running!, said Homer Simpson. (Really, its in the release.)  The show has run since 1990, and it remains one of Foxs highest-rated programs among adults 18-49.  The founder of The Daily Caller will take over the 7 p.m. slot vacated earlier this year by On the Record withGreta Van Susteren, who left following Roger Ailes resignation.  Carlson has hosted shows previously on MSNBC and CNN.  Meanwhile, in other programming:  Also, New Girl will move to 8 p.m. starting Jan. 3, Hells Kitchen moves to Thursdays on Jan. 5, and Rosewood swaps to Fridays on Jan. 6 (not a good sign for the second-year show).  * ABCs Scandal returns to the lineup on Jan. 19. The show will take over for Notorious, whose order has been cut.  Nov. 2: Fox wants to give its big midseason show, Star, the splashiest start possible.  The network said it will debut the new drama from Lee Daniels, about three young singers chasing fame, behind Daniels current smash, Empire.  Star will bow Dec. 14 at 9 p.m., right after the Empire fall finale at 8 p.m. The big lead-in should ensure Star gets off to a good start, and its already gotten lots of buzz, with Daniels behind it and Queen Latifah and Benjamin Bratt among the stars.  Meanwhile, in other programming:  * Netflix has renewed Longmire for a sixth and final season. The show originally aired on A&E and moved to Netflix after it was canceled.  Nov. 1: NBC wants more time with Timeless.  The network has picked up three additional episodes of the new drama, bringing its season order to 16.  Thats not quite the 22 episodes that most full-season pickups consist of, but it signals the network is still interested in the show if not fully committed. NBC indicated the smaller order is because of the great amount of production time needed on the time travel series.  Timeless dropped to a series-low 1.1 adults 18-49 rating Monday night in its most recent episode, on a night where broadcast was hit hard by Halloween-related TV usage declines.  Also at NBC, the network has slated a Feb. 27 premiere for Taken, the drama based on the Liam Neeson film. In fact, Taken will take over the 10 p.m. Monday slot vacated by Timeless.  Meanwhile, in other programming:  * Fox has picked up a full second season of Lucifer, its Monday night drama. It had initially ordered 13 episodes of the show.  * HBOs The Young Pope, a 10-episode limited series about the first American pope, will bow Jan. 15 at 9 p.m. and air part two the following night at the same time. It will continue with the Sunday-Monday run for four more weeks.  Oct. 27: At a time when reboots and revivals are the hot thing on television, this was probably inevitable.  NBC is in talks for a reboot of Will & Grace, the popular late 90s to early 2000s sitcom. The shows four stars recently filmed a mini-episode in honor of the election.  The video went viral, and that apparently clued NBC in that the show still has a lot of fans.  Its reportedly a 10-episode order, but the network has not confirmed it yet.  Oct. 25: Its not canceled. But its definitely not going to be around much longer.  ABC has slashed the order for new drama Notorious from 13 to 10 episodes, according to The Hollywood Reporter.  The show has averaged a 1.0 adults 18-49 rating, according to Nielsen. While its seeing strong DVR playback, its losing more than half of its lead-in from Greys Anatomy, which ABC cant afford.  The networks have become more reluctant to outright cancel shows in this era of ratings declines. But by trimming the order, ABC can get something else on the air more quickly  possibly Scandal, which took the fall off for star Kerry Washingtons pregnancy.  Oct. 24: The CW hasnt made any decisions about its new fall shows yet, but its bringing back a slew of summer ones.  The network has renewed Whose Line Is It Anyway, Penn & Teller: Fool Us and Masters of Illusion for next summer.  It will be the fifth season for Anyway, a revival of the 1990s ABC show.  Not on the list of renewals: MADtv, which was revived over the summer years after ending its Fox run. That doesnt mean the show wont return, but its not a great sign.  Oct. 18: The news is not unexpected, but its now official.  CBS has canceled BrainDead and American Gothic, its two new summer dramas.  Both drew low ratings for the network, and they marked a departure from CBSs traditionally procedural-focused programming.  Meanwhile, in other programming:  * Months before season two even debuts, FX has picked up American Crime Story for a third season.  * Hulu has renewed Difficult People for a third season.  Oct. 16: Heres something utterly unsurprising: The Walking Dead will be back for an eighth season.  AMC has renewed TVs top scripted series among adults 18-49, a week before season seven debuts.  The shows ratings have declined a bit over the past two years but its still easily the most-watched program on cable and beats everything on broadcast with the exception of Sunday Night Football.  Meanwhile, in other programming:  * MTV has renewed Scream for a third season, though it will be shorter than the previous two.  * Lifetime has ordered the drama Mary Kills People, about assisted suicide.  Oct. 10:Halt and Catch Fire will return for another season, but it will be the last.  AMC has been renewed for a fourth and final season.  The program is the lowest-rated of AMCs originals among adults 18-49, posting a 0.2 in its soon-to-conclude third season.  Meanwhile, in other programming:  * @Midnight has been renewed for a fourth season on Comedy Central.  Oct. 4: No shocker hereFX wants more American Horror Story.  The network has renewed its top program for a seventh season.  Horror has averaged a 2.1 adults 18-49 rating this fall, making it one of the top programs on cable. It also regularly tops broadcast competition in its 10 p.m. Wednesday timeslot.  The shows up 40 percent from last season.  Meanwhile, in other programming:  * Netflix has slated its latest superhero series, Marvels Iron Fist, to debut March 17 of next year. It will also bow A Series of Unfortunate Events on Jan. 13 of next year.  The surreal game show, popular in the 1970s and 80s, is being revived by the network. Will Arnett will executive produce the program, which has received a 10-episode order.  Meanwhile, in other programming:  NBC has officially canceled summer drama dud Aquarius, which everyone pretty much figured was a gonner.

HBO has picked up High Maintenance for a second season. The show about middle-class pot dealers originated as a web series.

The network has picked up a full season of the second-year comedy, which returned to solid numbers last week, posting a 1.5 adults 18-49 rating in its debut.  The network had previously ordered just 13 episodes, wanting to see how the returning program would hold up in its new Thursday timeslot.

NBC has also picked up summers top new program, Better Late Than Never, for a second season.  Sept. 21: CBS was reamed at the Television Critics Association tour over the summer for the lack of diversity in its shows. All sixof the leads on its new fall shows are white males.  Perhaps not coincidentally, the network has picked up a new comedy  Superior Donuts  with an African-American lead (Jermaine Fowler) for midseason.  The network has ordered 13 episodes of the show, which was a contender for the fall schedule but was sent back to redevelop. It swapped in a new co-lead (Judd Hirsch) and lured in veteran sitcom actress Katey Sagal.  CBS has not said when it will bow.  Meanwhile, in other programming:  * FX has renewed the comedies Atlanta and Better Things for second seasons.  Sept. 19:ESPN2 is the latest network to aim squarely at Hispanic Millennials.

The program is aimed at young Hispanics who speak English and Spanish, and the network says it will have interactive elements. Viewers can call in, using whichever language they prefer, though the show will be produced in English.  Advertisers are clearly interested. The show has signed Toyota, Gillette, Allstate and Taco Bell as inaugural sponsors.  The show will be hosted by Jorge Sedano, co-host of ESPNLAs Mornings with Keyshawn and Jorge and LZ, Bernardo Osuna, host of ESPN Deportes A Los Golpes, and ESPNDeportes.com reporter Marly Rivera.

Sept. 13: CBS has decided to pull back on its planned docu-series on JonBenet Ramsey, the child beauty queen who was killed20 years ago and whose murder remains unsolved.  The network had planned to air a six-hour look at the case, which it announced earlier this year.  But since then, a slew of networks, from NBC to A&E, have aired shows focused on Ramsey, before CBSs debuted, which apparently made the idea of three nights of the show less appealing.  The docu-series will still air two-hour blocks on Sunday and Monday, but CBS will eliminated the conclusion on Sept. 25. Instead, it will bring back NCIS: Los Angeles a week earlier than planned, giving it a two-hour premiere.  Sept. 12: Just hours before the shows fifth-season finale, NBC has renewed American Ninja Warrior for a sixth year.

Meanwhile, in other programming:  * ABC has canceled the summer drama Mistresses after four seasons.  * Fox has renewed Hells Kitchen for seasons 17 and 18.  Sept. 7: FX will bid farewell to Tyrant this weekend.  The network has decided to end the show, turning tonights season-three finale into a series ender.

The drama has averaged a 0.2 adults 18-49 rating, according to Nielsen, off 45 percent from season two.  Meanwhile, in other programming :  * ABC picked up Bachelor in Paradise and After Paradise for another season apiece.  Sept. 6: USA is sticking with Queen of the South, though not without changes.  The network has renewed the program, an adaptation of Telemundos hit telenovela La Reina del Sur.  But its hiring a new showrunner (Natalie Chaidez) for the drama, which averaged a 0.4 adults 18-49 rating in its first season.

Sept. 5: Two cable series are coming to a close, one after a much longer run than the other.  Lifetimes Devious Maids and AMCs Feed the Beast have both been axed.

The decision is not a huge surprise but another year certainly wasnt guaranteed. The show has seen ratings decline from season one and has set several series lows in its current second season, posting just a 0.2 adults 18-49 rating last week.  That said, the program does see solid DVR upticks and online engagement, and those things have become increasingly important to networks.

July 18: As viewershad feared, the next season of Game of Thrones will not appear until next summer.  Thats later than the typical March or April premiere date for HBOs top program.  In an interesting twist, it may mean good things for competitors to the show in the Emmy drama category, where Thrones led all shows when last weeks nominations were released.  A summer premiere would put Thrones too late to compete in the 2017 awards, opening up the category a bit for other programs.  Meanwhile, in other programming:  * The new Star Trek program launching on CBS All Access next year will also be carried by Netflix in 188 countries, though not in the U.S. and Canada, where CBS is hoping to drive subscriptions to the over-the-top network by introducing the new show.

Simpson  July 11: USA Network has decided to delay the series premiere of Shooter, its new drama about a sniper, in light of the recent shootings in Dallas.  The channel had planned to bow the program on July 19. Instead, it will delay it by a week, to July 26.

The move comes following an attack on Dallas police by a sniper that killed five officers over the weekend.

Still, the show had improved its timeslot sharply versus last summer.  Meanwhile, in other programming:  * TBS has renewed Wrecked and Angie Tribeca for one more season apiece.  * TNT has picked up Animal Kingdom for a second season.

We have enormous respect for the creative team and cast for their hard work and passion on this project.  The show, a behind-the-scenes collaboration by Martin Scorsese and Mick Jagger, lost its showrunner shortly after the first season ended, which may have impacted HBOs decision. It had renewed the show for season two right after its first-season debut.  The show never gained any traction in viewers, and it was going to have a major creative overhaul before season two.  Meanwhile, in other programming:  * FX has renewed the animated comedy Archer for threeseasons.  * Freeform, which like ABC is owned by Disney, has ordered a spinoff of ABCs The Bachelor called Ben and Lauren: Happily Ever After.

The shows producer, Lionsgate TV, was aggressive in looking to continue the show after its surprise cancellation.

The drama, which was canceled last month by ABC, has been aggressively shopped to other networks by producer Lionsgate Television, and word is one of them has bit.

Minds is among CBSs top-rated dramas, but it has a steep licensing fee because its been around so long, which led to the delay in its renewal.

The show wont star Kiefer Sutherland or any others from the original cast but will employ the same real-time dynamic that made the original so unique.  Star is a musical drama from Lee Daniels, the man who co-created Empire. Its not a spinoff of the latter but it is set in a similar world, focused on three female singers who dream of making it big. The cast includes Queen Latifah and Benjamin Bratt.  Also Wednesday, CBS said it is sticking with its daytime lineup, after seeing viewership rise 2 percent this season for the full slate of shows, a rarity in this era of declining ratings.

We are going to figure out nudity down the road, as long as its tasteful.  Any Given Wednesday With Bill Simmons will also be available on HBO Now, HBO Go and HBO On Demand.  That Megyn Kelly special the network scheduled for May will in fact be an interview with Donald Trump, marking the first time that Kelly will sit down with the leading presidential candidate since last summer, when he accused her of asking unfair questions during the first Republican debate on Fox News Channel.  Hes taken to Twitter multiple times since complaining about Kelly.  The special, which will air at 8 p.m. Tuesday, May 17, near the end of the sweeps period, is sure to draw good numbers for Fox.  FNC will air excerpts of the interview starting May 18 on Kellys primetime show, The Kelly File.  April 21: HBO isnt waiting to see how Game of Thrones, Veep and Silicon Valley perform in their upcoming season debuts.  The network renewed all three shows on Thursday, days before they return with new seasons on Sunday night.

The show recently aired its second-season finale, averaging 1.2 million total viewers. The comedy was one of Bravos first forays into scripted programming.  Its very rare for a show to get a three-season pickup. On broadcast, the last show to do so was The Big Bang Theory.  Fox said Tuesday it has renewed the show, its top-rated program on Tuesday nights, where its entire lineup has struggled.  There was some question whether Girl would be back.  Once one of the networks top scripted shows, its ratings have plummeted over the past few years, and Fox renewed Brooklyn Nine-Nine and Last Man on Earth a few weeks ago but was mum on Girl.  * Man Seeking Woman will have another season to seek.

April 7: Fox has made an affirmative decision on two first-year bubble shows.  The network has picked up Rosewood and Lucifer for second seasons.  Both shows had the good fortune of airing behind big hits for the network, Empire and The X-Files, respectively, which helped them post respectable numbers.  Lucifer is Foxs top new show with an average 1.6 adults 18-49 Nielsen rating.Rosewood has averaged a 1.4.  April 5: NBC has renewed yet another show for next season.  The network, which has already handed out orders to a slew of dramas and one comedy, has picked up Grimm for a sixth season.  The show, which airs on Friday nights, has averaged a 0.9 adults 18-49 Nielsen rating this season, and it grows by 89 percent when seven-day DVR playback is added.

The Gang is gunning for your record.  FXX has renewed Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia for a 13th and 14th season, which will tie The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet as the longest-running sitcom ever on American television.  The show ranked as the top basic cable comedy in adults 18-49 and 18-34 during its recently ended 11th season. But it should be noted that there are more dramas on cable than comedies.  March 29: Comedy Central will keep yukking it up with Daniel Tosh for another season.  The network renewed Tosh.0 for a ninth season Tuesday, and also picked up or renewed seven other TV and digital series.  Review will air for a third and final season (which had already been widely reported prior to this confirmation). This is Not Happening also receiveda third-season renewal.  Drunk History got a fourth-season pickup, and the network also ordered 10 additional first-season episodes of Not Safe with Nikki Glaser.

After just two episodes, Little Big Shots has been renewed by NBC for a second season.

The network on Friday picked up 11 shows:Arrow, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, DCs Legends of Tomorrow, The Flash, iZombie, Jane The Virgin, The Originals, Reign, Supernatural, The Vampire Diaries and The 100.  There are no question marks left heading into the May upfrontthats every series currently airing on the network.  None is a hugesurprise, though the mass pickup is unusual. Perhaps The 100 could be called a bubbleshow, but the network has been notably upbeat about its programming this year and has seen steady ratings.  The fact that its willing to nurture Girlfriend, among its lowest-rated programs, says a lot about the networks recent commitment to quality over live-plus-same-day ratings, a stance media buyers like.  Meanwhile, in other programming:  * WGN has picked up The Outsiders for a second season.  * Freeforms Switched at Birth will end after its upcoming fifth season.  * Maya Rudolphs new NBC variety show will bow May 31.

In March 2017, the web site The Last Line Of Defense published a fake news article reporting thatlong-running NBC comedy sketch showSaturday Night Livewas in the midst of its lowest-rated season and wouldbe cancelled at the end of the year:  After 40 years of successful ratings, springboarding dozens of careers of comedic brilliance to super-stardom, Saturday Night Live has fallen flat. By forgetting that its a comedy variety show and not a leftist propaganda outlet, the shows writers and actors have doomed it to oblivion. NBC released a statement this morning announcing that due to the lowest ratings of all time and the highest number of viewer complaints and general discourse from the American public, this will be the final season of Saturday Night Live:  There was no truth to this story. The Last Line Of Defense is a well-known purveyor of fake newsand carries a disclaimer labeling its content as fiction:  The Resistance may include information from sources that may or may not be reliable and facts that dont necessarily exist. All articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney. Pictures that represent actual people should be considered altered and not in any way real.  In addition to the satirical origins of this story, the claim that Saturday Night Live has sunk to its lowest ratings in history during its 42 season is demonstrably false. Although Vulture noted that directly comparing the current seasons ratings for SNL to those of years past is problematic due to the fact that Nielsens rating mechanisms have changed since the show first aired in 1975, the comedy show has seen a viewer surge during the 2016-17 season, due in large part to the popularity of the programs political skewerings of President Trump and his administration:  While historical comparisons using total-viewer data is a bit tricky given population growth and the advent of time-shifting technology about a decade ago, the audience surge for SNL is impressive from almost any angle. A more precise measurement of SNLs Trumpian surge is probably its ratings among adults under 50. This stat isnt skewed by population growth (since it represents the percentage of the overall young-adult audience watching), and its also the rating used most frequently by NBC to sell advertising on the show. Including DVR replays, SNL this season is notching around a 3.5 rating in the demo, up an eye-popping 20 percent versus this point last season. Assuming these numbers hold, the show (as of last week) is on track to have its best performance among young adults since the 200708 season, when interest in the Democratic and Republican presidential primaries drove tune-in and boosted SNL to a 4.3 demo rating. While not quite as flashy as saying SNL is having its best season in two decades, its the sort of performance thats making NBCs ad sales force very, very happy  and no doubt making the man most responsible for the ratings spike  wait for it  very, very sad!";hoax

The show premiered on NBC on October 11, 1975, under the original title NBC's Saturday Night. The show's comedy sketches, which parody contemporary culture and politics, are performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members. Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest (who usually delivers an opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast) and features performances by a musical guest. An episode normally begins with a cold open sketch that ends with someone breaking character and proclaiming, \"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!\", properly beginning the show.  In 1980, Michaels left the series to explore other opportunities. He was replaced by Jean Doumanian, who was replaced by Ebersol after a season of bad reviews. Ebersol ran the show until 1985, when Michaels returned; Michaels has remained since then. Many of SNL's cast found national stardom while appearing on the show, and achieved success in film and television, both in front of and behind the camera. Others associated with the show, such as writers, have gone on to successful careers creating, writing, or starring in TV and film.  Broadcast from Studio 8H at NBC's headquarters in the Comcast Building, SNL has aired 823 episodes since its debut, and began its forty-second season on October 1, 2016, making it one of the longest-running network television programs in the United States. The show format has been developed and recreated in several countries, meeting with different levels of success. Successful sketches have seen life outside of the show as feature films, although only two met with critical and financial success: The Blues Brothers (1980) and Wayne's World (1992). The show has been marketed in other ways, including home media releases of \"best of\" and whole seasons, and books and documentaries about behind-the-scenes activities of running and developing the show.  Throughout four decades on air, Saturday Night Live has received a number of awards, including 50 Primetime Emmy Awards, two Peabody Awards, and three Writers Guild of America Awards. In 2000, it was inducted into the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame. It was ranked tenth in TV Guide's \"50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time\" list, and in 2007 it was listed as one of Time magazine's \"100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME\". As of 2012, it has received 156 Emmy nominations, the most received by any TV show. The live aspect of the show has resulted in several controversies and acts of censorship, with mistakes and intentional acts of sabotage by performers as well as guests.  From 1965 until September 1975, NBC ran The Best of Carson reruns of The Tonight Show, airing them on either Saturday or Sunday night at local affiliates' discretion (originally known as The Saturday/Sunday Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson). In 1974, Johnny Carson announced that he wanted the weekend shows pulled and saved so that they could be aired during weeknights, allowing him to take time off.[1]  In 1974, NBC president Herbert Schlosser approached his vice president of late night programming, Dick Ebersol, and asked him to create a show to fill the Saturday night time slot. At the suggestion of Paramount Pictures executive Barry Diller, Schlosser and Ebersol then approached Lorne Michaels. Over the next three weeks, Ebersol and Michaels developed the latter's idea for a variety show featuring high-concept comedy sketches, political satire, and music performances. By 1975 Michaels had assembled a talented cast, including Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi, Chevy Chase, Jane Curtin, Garrett Morris, Laraine Newman, Michael O'Donoghue, Gilda Radner,[2] and George Coe.[3] The show was originally called NBC's Saturday Night, because Saturday Night Live was in use by Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell on the rival network ABC.[4] NBC purchased the rights to the name in 1976 and officially adopted the new title on March 26, 1977.[5]  Debuting on October 11, 1975,[6] the show immediately developed a cult following, eventually becoming a mainstream hit and spawning (in 1978) \"Best of Saturday Night Live\" compilations that reached viewers who could not stay awake for the live broadcasts. But during the first season in 1975 and 1976, according to a book about the show authored by Doug Hill and Jeff Weingrad, some NBC executives were not satisfied with the show's Nielsen ratings and shares.[7] Lorne Michaels pointed out to them that Nielsen's measurement of demographics indicated that baby boomers constituted a large majority of the viewers who did commit to watching the show, and many of them watched little else on television.[8] In 1975 and 1976, they were the most desirable demographic for television advertisers. NBC executives agreed with Michaels and decided to keep the show on the air despite many angry letters and phone calls that the network received from viewers who were offended by certain sketches.[9]  They included a Weekend Update segment on April 24, 1976, the 18th episode, that ridiculed Aspen, Colorado murder suspect Claudine Longet and warranted an on-air apology by announcer Don Pardo during the following episode.[10] Herminio Traviesas, a censor who was vice president of the network's Standards and Practices department, objected to cast member Laraine Newman's use of the term \"pissed off\" in the March 13, 1976 episode with host Anthony Perkins, according to the book by Hill and Weingrad, and was in the process of placing the show on a permanent delay of several seconds, instead of live, but he changed his mind after Newman personally apologized to him.[11]  Chevy Chase left the show in November of the second season and was replaced a few months later by the then-unknown comic actor Bill Murray. Aykroyd and Belushi left the show in 1979 after the end of season four. In May 1980 (after season five), Michaelsemotionally and physically exhaustedrequested to put the show on hiatus for a year to give him time and energy to pursue other projects. Concerned that the show would be cancelled without him, Michaels suggested writers Al Franken, Tom Davis, and Jim Downey as his replacements. NBC president Fred Silverman disliked Franken, however, and was infuriated by Franken's Weekend Update routine called \"Limo for a Lame-O\", a scathing critique of Silverman's job performance at the network and his insistence on traveling by limousine at the network's expense. Silverman blamed Michaels for approving this Weekend Update segment. Unable to get the deal he wanted, Michaels chose to leave NBC for Paramount Pictures, intending to take his associate producer, Jean Doumanian, with him. Michaels later learned that Doumanian had been given his position at SNL after being recommended by her friend, NBC vice president Barbara Gallagher. Michaels' departure led to most of the cast and writing staff leaving the show.  The reputation of the show as a springboard to fame meant that many aspiring stars were eager to join the new series. Doumanian was tasked with hiring a full cast and writing staff in less than three months, and NBC immediately cut the show's budget from the previous $1 million per episode down to just $350,000. Doumanian faced resentment and sabotage from the remaining Michaels staff, particularly males who did not appreciate a woman believing she could take Michaels' place. The season was a disaster; ratings plummeted, and audiences failed to connect to the original cast's replacements, such as Charles Rocket and Ann Risley. Doumanian's fate was sealed when, during a sketch, Rocket said \"fuck\" on live television. After only ten months, Doumanian was dismissed.[19] Although executives suggested that SNL be left to die, network chief Brandon Tartikoff wanted to keep the show on the air, believing that the concept was more important to the network than money. Tartikoff turned to Ebersol as his choice for the new producer. Ebersol previously had been fired by Silverman. Ebersol gained Michaels' approval in an attempt to avoid the same staff sabotage that had blighted Doumanian's tenure.  Ebersol's tenure saw commercial success, but was considered lackluster compared to the Michaels era, except for the breakout of cast member Eddie Murphy. Murphy, the main draw of the cast, left in 1984 to pursue his already successful film career, and Ebersol decided to again rebuild the cast. He broke with history by hiring established comedians such as Billy Crystal and Martin Short who could bring their already successful material to the show. Ebersol's final year with this new cast is considered one of the series' funniest, but had strayed far from the precedent-shattering show that Michaels had created. After that season, Ebersol wanted a more significant revamp, including departing from the show's established \"live\" format.[citation needed] Following unsuccessful forays into film and television, in need of money, and eager not to see Tartikoff cancel the show, Michaels finally returned in 1985 after Ebersol opted not to. The show was again recast, with Michaels borrowing Ebersol's idea, and seeking out established actors such as Joan Cusack and Robert Downey, Jr. The cast and writers struggled creatively, and in April 1986, Tartikoff made the decision to cancel the show, until he was convinced by producer Bernie Brillstein to give it one more year. The show was renewed but for the first time in its history, for only thirteen episodes instead of the usual twenty-two. Michaels again fired most of the cast and, learning his lesson from the previous seasons, sought out unknown talent such as Dana Carvey and Phil Hartman instead of known names.  The show ran successfully again until it lost Carvey and Hartman, two of its biggest stars, between 1992 and 1994. Wanting to increase SNL's ratings and profitability, then-NBC West Coast president Don Ohlmeyer and other executives began to actively interfere in the show, recommending that new stars such as Chris Farley and Adam Sandler be fired because Ohlmeyer did not \"get\" them, and critiquing the costly nature of performing the show live. The show faced increasing criticism from the press and cast, in part encouraged by the NBC executives hoping to weaken Michaels' position. Michaels received a lucrative offer to develop a Saturday night project for CBS during this time, but remained loyal to SNL. By 1995, Farley and Sandler were fired, and Mike Myers, another popular cast member, had left for a film career, but a new cast waited to replace them, featuring the likes of Will Ferrell, Jimmy Fallon, and Tina Fey. The show focused on performers, and writers were forced to supply material for the cast's existing characters before they could write original sketches. By 1997, Ohlmeyer renewed his focus on limiting Michaels' independence, forcing the removal of writer Jim Downey and cast member Norm Macdonald.  The original 1975 cast of SNL, officially known on-air as \"The Not Ready For Prime-Time Players\",[33] a term coined by writer Herb Sargent, included Laraine Newman, John Belushi, Jane Curtin, Gilda Radner, Dan Aykroyd, Garrett Morris, and Chevy Chase. Radner was the first person hired after Michaels himself. Although Chase became a performer, he was hired on a one-year writer contract, and refused to sign the performer contract that was repeatedly given to him, allowing him to leave the show after the first season in 1976. Newman was brought aboard after having a prior working relationship with Michaels. Morris was initially brought in as a writer, but attempts to have him fired by another writer led Michaels to have Morris audition for the cast, where he turned in a successful performance. Curtin and Belushi were the last two cast members hired. Belushi had a disdain for television and had repeatedly turned down offers to appear on other shows, but decided to work with the show because of the involvement of Radner, and writers Anne Beatts and Michael O'Donoghue. Michaels was still reluctant to hire Belushi, believing he would be a source of trouble for the show, but Beatts, O'Donoghue, and Ebersol successfully argued for his inclusion.  After Chase left the show, he was replaced by Bill Murray, whom Michaels had intended to hire for the first-season cast, but was unable to because of budget restrictions. When Chase returned to host in 1978, he found the remaining cast resentful at his departure and his success, particularly Belushi. Murray, goaded by the rest of the cast, and Chase came to blows shortly before the show. Chase's departure for film made Michaels possessive of his talent; he threatened to fire Aykroyd if he took the role of D-Day in the 1978 comedy Animal House, and later refused to allow SNL musician Paul Shaffer to participate in The Blues Brothers (1980) with Aykroyd and Belushi after they left in 1979 to pursue film careers.[42] Michaels began to struggle to hold the remaining cast together in the wake of Chase, Aykroyd, and Belushi's independent successes. Radner had a one-woman Broadway show and Murray starred in the 1979 comedy Meatballs. In 1980, when Michaels chose to leave the series to pursue other interests, he was followed by the remaining original cast, Curtin, Newman, and Morris, Murray, and additional cast members.[42]  The Doumanian-era cast faced immediate comparison to the beloved former cast and were not received favorably. Ebersol fired the majority of her hires, except for two unknown comedians: Eddie Murphy and Joe Piscopo. Talent coordinator Neil Levy claimed Murphy contacted and pleaded with him for a role on the show, and after seeing him audition, Levy fought with Doumanian to cast him instead of Robert Townsend. Doumanian wanted only one black cast member and favored Townsend, but Levy convinced her to choose Murphy. Doumanian, however, also claimed credit for discovering Murphy and fighting with NBC executives to bring him onto the show. Even so, Murphy would languish as a background character until Ebersol took charge, after which Murphy was credited with much of that era's success.[47] Murphy's star exploded, and he quickly appeared in films such as 48 Hrs. and Trading Places, before leaving for his film career in early 1984. Much of the Ebersol cast departed after the 198384 season and were replaced with established comedians who could supply their own material, but at an inflated cost; Billy Crystal and Martin Short were paid $25,000 and $20,000 per episode respectively, a far cry from earlier salaries. Michaels' return in 1985 saw a cast reset that featured established talent such as Robert Downey Jr., Jon Lovitz and Dennis Miller. The season was poorly received, and another reset followed in 1986. Learning his lesson from the previous season, Michaels avoided known talent in favor of actual ability. He kept Lovitz, Miller and Nora Dunn, and brought in new, untested talent such as Dana Carvey, Phil Hartman, and Jan Hooks, who together would define a new era on the show into the early 1990s.  In 1989-90, new talent such as Mike Myers, Adam Sandler, and Chris Farley were added. Afraid of cast members leaving for film careers, Michaels had overcrowded the cast, causing a divide between the veteran members and the new, younger talent, increasing competition for limited screen time. By 1995, Carvey and Hartman had left, taking with them a virtual army of characters, Myers quit for his movie career, and increasing network pressure forced Michaels to fire Sandler and Farley. The show saw its next major overhaul, bringing in a new cast including Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, and Jimmy Fallon. While cast members would leave over the following two decades, the show saw its next biggest transition in 2013, with the addition of 6 cast members to compensate for the departure of several longtime cast members like Bill Hader, Jason Sudeikis, and Fred Armisen.[53]  SNL has featured over 140 cast members including, besides the above-mentioned players, Rachel Dratch, Amy Poehler, Chris Rock, David Spade, Will Forte, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Tracy Morgan, Chris Parnell, Maya Rudolph, Andy Samberg, Kristen Wiig, and many others. Darrell Hammond is the longest-serving cast member, having been a part of the cast for fourteen years between 1995 and 2009, and returned in 2014 as the show's announcer following the death of Don Pardo.[54][55] Those selected to join the cast of SNL are normally already accomplished performers, recruited from improvisational comedy groups such as The Groundlings (Ferrell, Hartman, Lovitz, Wiig[57]) and The Second City (Aykroyd, Farley, Fey,[58] Tim Meadows), or established stand-up comedians (Carvey, Sandler, Rock, Norm Macdonald), who already possess the training or experience necessary for SNL.[59]  Of the many roles available in the show, one of the longest-running and most coveted is being the host of \"Weekend Update\", a segment which has alternated between having one or two hosts, and which allows the cast members involved to perform as themselves and be on camera for an extended period of time. Many of the \"Weekend Update\" hosts have gone on to find greater success outside of the show, including: Chase, Curtin, Murray, Miller, Macdonald, Fey, Fallon, and Poehler. From 2008, Seth Meyers was the solo host of \"Weekend Update\", before being partnered with Cecily Strong in 2013. After Meyers left for Late Night with Seth Meyers in February 2014, Strong was paired with head writer Colin Jost.[63] The cast is divided into two tiers: the more established group of repertory players; and newer, unproven cast members known as featured players, who may eventually be promoted to the repertory stable.  The cast were often contracted from anywhere between five and six years to the show,[65][66] but starting with the 19992000 season, new hires were tied to a rewritten contract that allowed NBC to take a cast member in at least their second year and put them in an NBC sitcom. Cast are given the option of rejecting the first two sitcom offers but must accept the third offer, with the sitcom contract length dictated by NBC and potentially lasting up to six years.[66] The move drew criticism from talent agents and managers who believed that a cast member could be locked into a contract with NBC for twelve years; six on SNL and then six on a sitcom. The contract also optioned the cast member for three feature films produced by SNL Films, a company owned by NBC, Paramount Pictures, and Michaels. The new contracts were reportedly developed after many previously unknown cast, such as Myers and Sandler, gained fame on SNL only to leave and make money for other studios.[66] In a 2010 interview, Wiig was reported to be contracted to SNL for a total of seven years.[67] The contracts also contain a network option which allows NBC to remove a cast member at any time. In the first season of the show, cast were paid $750 per episode, rising to $2,000 by season two, and $4,000 by season four. By the late 1990s, new cast members received a salary between $5,000[66] and $5,500 per episode, increasing to $6,000 in the second year and up to $12,500 for a cast member in their fifth year. Performers could earn an additional $1,500 per episode for writing a sketch which made it to air. In 2001, Ferrell became the highest paid cast member, being paid $350,000 per season (approximately $17,500 per episode).[70] In 2014, Sasheer Zamata was added as a cast member in mid-season after criticism about the show's lack of an African-American woman.[71][72][73]  As of the 201314 season, Colin Jost and Rob Klein are the show's co-head writers. Meyers had been co-head writer since 2005 and became the single head writer from 2008 to 2012. The \"Weekend Update\" segment has its own dedicated team of writers led by head writer and producer Alex Baze as of the 201112 season.[74][75][76] Scenes on \"Weekend Update\" that involve members of the cast acting in-character alongside the host are often written by staff writers outside of the dedicated \"Weekend Update\" team, who know those characters better.[76]  SNL writers are often also performers or experienced in writing and improvisational comedy. Many are hired from similar backgrounds such as The Groundlings, Second City, Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre, and ImprovOlympic.[42] Comedian Jim Downey was head writer for nine years beginning in 1985.[77] Experienced writers with backgrounds in television shows are also sometimes brought into the SNL writing room. Like the SNL cast that step before the cameras, many of the writers have been able to find their own success outside the show such as Conan O'Brien, who was brought into SNL from The Groundlings, went on to writing for The Simpsons, and eventually began hosting his own show,[78] and former head writer Adam McKay who, along with performer Ferrell, founded the successful comedy website Funny or Die.[79] In 2000, Tina Fey became the first female SNL head writer[80][81] and successfully made the transition to starring on the show,[82] as well as writing and starring in feature films,[83][84][85] and ultimately creating and starring in her own show 30 Rockpartly based on her SNL experiences.[86] In 2005, Fey was being paid $1.5 million per season for her dual role as head writer and performer.[87]  Don Pardo served as the announcer for the series when it began[88] and continued in the role for all but season seven between 1981 and 1982, when Michaels had left and Mel Brandt and Bill Hanrahan filled the announcing role. In 2004, Pardo announced that he would step down from his position, but then continued in the role until 2009 where he again announced his retirement, but then continued into the 200910 season.[88] In 2010, then 92-year-old Pardo was reported to be again considering his retirement, but continued to serve as announcer until his death at age 96 on August 18, 2014, following the 39th season. Apart from a brief period in 2006 in which Pardo pre-recorded his announcements at his home in Arizona, he flew to New York City to perform his announcing duties live.[88][89] Cast members Joe Piscopo[90] and Darrell Hammond also periodically impersonated Pardo and fulfilled his announcing duties when Pardo was unavailable. Hammond took over as full-time announcer starting with season 40.[92]  A typical episode of SNL will feature a single host chosen for their popularity or novelty, or because they have a film, album, or other work being released near the time of their appearance on the show. The host delivers the opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast. Traditionally the host of the show ends the opening monologue by introducing the musical guest for the night. Comedian George Carlin was the first to host SNL in the debut October 1975 episode;[94] three episodes later, Candice Bergen became the first female host and subsequently the first to host more than once. Hosts have been drawn from a wide spectrum of backgrounds, from actors, such as Christopher Walken, Buck Henry, and John Goodman, to musicians like Dolly Parton, to political activist Ralph Nader. Guests who have hosted five or more times are sometimes referred to as belonging to the Five-Timers Club, a term that originated on a sketch performed on Tom Hanks' fifth episode.[99] As of February 11, 2017, actor Alec Baldwin holds the record for most times hosting, having performed the duty on seventeen different occasions since 1990; Baldwin took the record from actor Steve Martin who had hosted fifteen times since 1976.[100]  Each episode also features a musical guest, a solo act or a band, who perform two to three musical numbers. Occasionally, the musical guest has also simultaneously served as the host. As of May 19, 2012, Dave Grohl is the most frequent musical guest, performing on eleven shows since 1992.[101] Michaels does not allow musical guests to perform using lip-synching tracks, believing it diminishes the live aspect of the show. Exceptions are only made when the musical act is focused on intense dance routines instead of vocals, where it is difficult to be both heavily physically active and sing simultaneously.[103] A 1975 performance by pop group ABBA was the first and only act to feature lip-synching, until the controversial 2004 performance of Ashlee Simpson.  The Saturday Night Live Band (also known as \"The Live Band\") is the house band for SNL. Academy Award-winning composer Howard Shore served as the first musical director, from 1975 to 1980, appearing in many musical sketches, including Howard Shore and His All-Nurse Band and (backing a U.S. Coast Guard chorus) Howard Shore and the Shore Patrol. Over the years, the band has featured several New York studio musicians including Paul Shaffer (19751980), Lou Marini (19751983), David Sanborn (1975), Michael Brecker (early 1980s), Ray Chew (19801983), Alan Rubin (19751983), Georg Wadenius (19791985), Steve Ferrone (1985), David Johansen (performing as Buster Poindexter), Tom Malone (who took over as musical director from 1981 to 1985), and G.E. Smith (musical director from 1985 to 1995). The band is currently under the leadership of Tower of Power alumnus Lenny Pickett, keyboardist Leon Pendarvis and Eli Bruegemann, who does not play in the band on the live show. The number of musicians has varied over the years, but the basic instrumentation has been three saxophones (alto, tenor and baritone), one trombone, one trumpet, and a rhythm section featuring two keyboards (piano and Hammond organ), a guitar, bass guitar, drums, and an extra percussionist, not a permanent part of the band until Valerie Naranjo's arrival in 1995. The 19831984 and 19841985 seasons featured the smallest band, a six-piece combo. The band plays instrumentals leading in and out of station breaks; affiliates who run no advertising during these interludes hear the band play complete songs behind a Saturday Night Live bumper graphic until the program resumes.[104]  Since the show's inception, SNL has aired from Studio 8H, located on floors 8 and 9 of the Comcast Building (formerly the RCA Building and GE Building) (30 Rockefeller Plaza, or \"30 Rock\"). The studio had originally been used as a radio soundstage for Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra. Michaels was dumbfounded when he originally inspected Studio 8H in 1975, and found it technically limited, outdated, in need of repair, and lacking the capacity to host a live show. Michaels demanded that NBC executives rebuild the studio and improve the acoustics to accommodate the intended musical acts, at a cost of approximately $300,000. Three of the first four shows of the 197677 season were shot at the former NBC Studios in Brooklyn, due to NBC News using Studio 8H for Presidential election coverage.[107]  During the summer 2005 shooting hiatus, crews began renovations on Studio 8H. With its thirty-first-season premiere in October 2005, the show began broadcasting in high-definition television, appearing letterboxed on conventional television screens. The offices of SNL writers, producers, and other staff can be found on the 17th floor of \"30 Rock\".  Production on an SNL episode will normally start on a Monday with a free-form pitch meeting[111] between the cast, writers, producers including Michaels, and the guest host, in Michaels' office, over two hours. The host is invited to pitch ideas during this meeting. Although some sketch writing may occur on the day, the bulk of the work revolves around pitching ideas. Tuesday is the only day dedicated purely to writing the scripts, a process which usually extends through the night into the following morning. Writing may not begin until 8pm on the Tuesday evening.[111] At 5pm on Wednesday, the sketches are read by the cast during a round-table meeting in the writers room,[111] attended by the writers and producers present during the pitch meeting, technical experts such as make-up artists, who may be required to realize certain sketch ideas such as those using prosthetics, and other producers, resulting in an attendance of approximately fifty people. At this point there may be at least 40 sketch ideas which are read-through in turn, lasting upwards of three hours.  After completion of the read-through, Michaels, the head writer, the guest host, and some of the show producers will move to Michaels' office to decide the layout of the show and decide which of the sketches will be developed for air. Once complete, the writers and cast are allowed into Michaels' office to view the show breakdown and learn whether or not their sketch has survived. Sketches may be rewritten starting the same day, but will certainly commence on Thursday, work focuses on developing and rewriting the remaining sketches, and possibly rehearsals.[111] If a sketch is still scheduled beyond Thursday, it is rehearsed on Friday or Saturday before moving to a rehearsal before a live audience at 8pm, again on Saturday before the live show.[111] After the rehearsal, Michaels will review the show lineup to ensure it meets a 90-minute length, and sketches that have made it as far as the live rehearsal may be removed. This often results in less than two days of rehearsal for the eight to twelve sketches that have made it to the stage that then may appear on the live broadcast. The opening monologue, spoken by the guest host, is given low priority and can be written as late as Saturday afternoon.  According to an interview with Fey in 2004, the three- to four-member dedicated \"Weekend Update\" writing team will write jokes throughout the week. The host(s) of \"Weekend Update\" will normally not work with, or read the scripts from, the team until Thursday evening, after the main show sketches have been finalized. The host(s) will then work on contributing to the script where necessary.[116][117]  With onsite facilities housed on floors 8 and 17 of Rockefeller Plaza, post-production duties on live broadcasts of Saturday Night Live include the mixing of audio and video elements by the Senior Audio Mixer, coupled with additional audio feeds consisting of music, sound effects, music scoring and pre-recorded voiceovers. All sources are stored digitally, with shows captured and segregated into individual elements to reorganise for future repeats and syndication. The production tracking system was migrated from primarily analog to digital in 1998, with live shows typically requiring 1.5 terabytes of storage, consisting of audio elements and 5 cameras' worth of visual elements.[118] Elements of Saturday Night Live that are pre-recorded, such as certain commercial parodies, SNL Digital Shorts, and show graphics are processed off-site in the post-production facilities of Broadway Video.[119][120]  Studio 8H production facilities are maintained by NBC Production Services. Video camera equipment includes four Sony BVP-700 CCD cameras, and two Sony BVP-750 CCD handheld cameras, both using Vinten pedestals. A GVG 4000-3 digital component production switcher, and GVG 7000 digital component routing switcher are used to route visual feeds to the control room, with multiple digital and analogue video recorders used to store footage. Graphics are provided by a Chyron Lyric Pro character generator and an Avid Deko character generator. Audio facilities consist of a Calrec T Series digitally controlled analogue mixing console, and a Yamaha digital mixing console used for tape playback support and utility audio work.[121] While exact budgets for other seasons are not known, the 39th season (2013-2014) had a budget of just over $70 million, for which it received a subsidy from New York State in the amount of $12.3 million.[122]  As of 2009, the opening title sequence and opening montage is shot using the Canon EOS 5D Mark II and Canon EOS 7D digital SLR cameras. Typical elements are recorded at 30fps, with slow-motion sequences shot at 60fps, both in full 1080p high definition.[123]  Edie Baskin was the original SNL photographer. She was hired after Michaels saw her photographs of Las Vegas and other work. Baskin helped create the opening title sequence for the show by taking photos of New York City at night. The first episode used publicity photos of Carlin as transitional bumpers between the show and commercial breaks, the second episode used photos Baskin had already taken of host Paul Simon. It was then that Michaels suggested that Baskin photograph the hosts for the bumpers instead of using publicity photos, beginning a tradition which continues today.  Since 1999, Mary Ellen Matthews has been the official photographer of SNL, responsible for devising distinctive photo layouts and aesthetics for still imagery used on the show. Matthews creates photo portraits of the hosts and musical guests of each episode which are used as commercial bumpers. The limited time frame between the host's involvement in the production process and the Live show requires Matthews to create makeshift photo studios on site at 30 Rock, with Matthews attempting to shoot the host on Tuesday and the musical guest on Thursday, although the availability of either can mean the photoshoot for both occurs as late as Thursday.[126] Matthews employs flattering portrait lighting with hard lights to achieve a Hollywood style. On the lighting, Matthews commented: \"I think it just helps the image pop off the screen...If you use soft or flat lighting, it becomes not as dimensional...The [classic Hollywood lighting] gives a little more contrast, and if I use edge lights and then light the background, it goes farther and farther back. I try to achieve that depth as much as I can.\"[127] Matthews is also responsible for taking cast photos, behind the scenes images, documenting rehearsals, and promotional photos. As of 2010, she has also been involved in directing videos, including the show title sequence.[127]  The show usually begins at 11:29:30p.m. (Eastern Time),[128] unless a delay occurs (more commonly, due to sporting events that run past 11:00p.m. Eastern, delaying local newscasts that lead into that week's SNL broadcast on most NBC stations). The show broadcasts for 92 minutes (counting commercial breaks), ending at 1:02a.m. For the Mountain except for KSNG, KSNK, and KQCD, and Pacific time zones, NBC airs the prerecorded live show usually unedited, mistakes notwithstanding.  Since the first opening in 1975 with Michael O'Donoghue, Chevy Chase, and John Belushi, the show has normally begun with a cold open sketch which ends with one or more cast members breaking character and proclaiming \"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!\", segueing into the opening credits that start immediately after.[3]  In February 2013, NBC began airing shortened hour-long repeats on Saturday evenings at 10:00p.m. Eastern Time during the regular season; the episodes scheduled are sometimes rebroadcasts of the previous week's episode if it originally aired as a first-run broadcast.[129] During the 201415 season, however, the prime time rebroadcasts consisted of a selection of 40 episodes from throughout the show's run under the title SNL Vintage to commemorate the program's 40th anniversary.  NBC and Broadway Video both hold the underlying rights to the show, while the copyright to every episode lies solely with NBC. From 1990 until 2004, and again since 2015, Comedy Central and its predecessor Ha! re-aired reruns of the series, after which E! Entertainment Television signed a deal to carry reruns.[130] Abbreviated 30- and 60-minute versions of the first five seasons aired as The Best of Saturday Night Live in syndication beginning in the 1980s, and later on Nick at Nite in 1988. In September 2010, reruns of most episodes made from 1998 onward began airing on VH1.[131] Starting in February 2016, VH1 and Comedy Central's sister channel Logo began airing reruns of the show on Sunday nights, launching its broadcast as counterprogramming for Super Bowl 50 and branding it the \"Live From New York, It's Satur-Gay Night!\" marathon. The reruns are mostly from 2006 onward.  Because SNL has been a huge success in America, channels in other countries have created their own versions of the show, including in the Middle East and North Africa region, Germany, Spain, South Korea, Japan, Canada, Finland and France.[132][133]  SNL is also aired in the Middle East and North Africa, OSN First HD every Saturday night, one week after it airs in the U.S.[134]  In India and Sri Lanka, Saturday Night Live! airs on Comedy Central, in an hour long version, one week after the U.S broadcast.[135]  Spain's version of the show was short-lived, only lasting a few episodes which aired on Thursdays and not Saturdays as the title suggested. This version copied heavily from the American version, in that they did their own versions of sketches that were already done on the original series.[132] Italy's Saturday Night Live From Milan aired for four seasons and used original material.[132][136]  On December 3, 2011, South Korea's SNL Korea premiered on cable channel tvN.[137][138][139][140] As of July 20, 2013, it is in its fourth consecutive season, with 20 episodes.[141]  The Japanese version Saturday Night Live JPN, which ran for six months in 2011, was created in part with Lorne Michaels' production company, Coca-Cola, Broadway Video and broadcast on Fuji TV networks. The show followed the same format with a few minor differences, being only 45 minutes long and hosted by a permanent host. The cast was made up of seasoned comedians who take center stage and newcomers who play the background roles. It was broadcast once a month, and ended after six episodes, as planned from the start.[132][136][142][143][144][excessive citations]  In 2014, two 90-minute specials were broadcast in French on Tl-Qubec in the Canadian province of Quebec under the title SNL Qubec; the specials were broadcast on February 8 and March 22, 2014. hosted by Louis-Jos Houde and Stphane Rousseau, and is the same format and length as the original SNL series.[145] Certain sketches from the original program, such as Debbie Downer and Schweddy Balls, were adapted into French, while other sketches were original material written directly for the Quebec series. On May 13, 2014, SNL Quebec was renewed for another eight episodes to be broadcast monthly over the 201415 season ending with a \"Best of\" compilation.[146] Tl-Qubec announced in May 2015 that the series would not be renewed due to funding cutbacks,[147] and Tlvision de Radio-Canada subsequently signed the show's production team and cast to produce a new series, Le nouveau show, for that network.[148]  The French channel M6 launched the pilot episode of its SNL adaptation, Le Saturday Night Live, in January 2017.  The episode scheduled for October 25, 1986, hosted by Rosanna Arquette, was not aired until November 8 due to NBC broadcasting Game 6 of the 1986 World Series between the New York Mets and Boston Red Sox; the game entered extra innings, causing that night's broadcast of SNL to be canceled. The show was recorded for the studio audience starting at 1:30a.m. Eastern Time, and broadcast two weeks later with an \"apology\" by Mets pitcher Ron Darling.[149]  The episode scheduled for February 10, 2001, hosted by Jennifer Lopez, aired 45 minutes late due to an XFL game. Lopez and the cast were not told they were airing on a delay. Michaels was so upset by the delay that the episode was rerun a mere three weeks later, and the fledgling league actually changed the rules in order to speed up play, and a deal was reached where the feed to future games would be cut off (whether the game had been decided or not) when SNL started so that no such incident would happen again.[150]  In 2002, SNL was ranked tenth on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time,[151] while in 2007 it was honored with inclusion on Time magazine's list of \"100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME.\"[128][152] In June 2013, the show was placed at number 25 on the list of the 101 best written shows of all time by the Writers Guild of America, assessing series from the previous 70 years.[153] In December 2013, TV Guide ranked it #18 on their list of the 60 Greatest Shows of All Time.[154] It is currently the 40th longest running TV show in the US.  In 2016, a New York Times study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that SNL \"is very much an urban show. It's most popular in cities throughout the country, and college towns. Amherst, Mass.; Madison, Wis.; and Ithaca, N.Y. are all among the top 10\".[155]  Saturday Night Live has won numerous awards since its debut, including 45 Primetime Emmy Awards,[156] 2 Peabody Awards,[157] and 4 Writers Guild of America Awards.[158] In 2009, it received a total of 13 Emmy nominations for a lifetime total of 126, breaking the record for the most award nominated show in Emmy history, previously set with 124 by hospital drama ER.[159][160] As of August 2012, it had received a record total of 156 Emmy nominations.[128][161]  19 cast members have received individual Emmy nominations in the show's history. These nominations were mostly in the category of Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program before that award was discontinued; since then, nominations have been in the Supporting Actor and Supporting Actress categories for comedy series. Of the 36 total nominations for these 19 performers, four have won Emmys: Chevy Chase (1976), Gilda Radner (1978), Dana Carvey (1993), and Kate McKinnon (2016).[156]  SNL has also had an effect on U.S. elections  most commonly presidential elections. Voters have reported that political sketches that were shown on the program influenced them in the voting booth. The so-called SNL Effect was observed during the 2008 presidential campaign, according to Mike Dabadie. Two-thirds of voters who responded to a poll said they had seen a broadcast of politically charged content on SNL, with ten percent saying that it had made a difference in their decision. Barack Obama was the beneficiary of the political content, with 59 percent saying they did in fact cast a vote for the Democratic then-nominee.[162]  Chevy Chase's bumbling impression of then-president Gerald Ford during the 1976 presidential election was cited as an influence on the election, and a quote commonly attributed to 2008 vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin stating \"I can see Russia from my house\" was actually spoken by SNL cast member Tina Fey while portraying Palin.[163] Several politicians have appeared on SNL, including President Gerald Ford (in 1976, during the show's first season), then-Senator Barack Obama (2007), Senator John McCain (2002 & 2008), Senator Hillary Clinton (2008 & 2015), and Governor Sarah Palin (2008), who appeared alongside Fey's Palin impression, resulting in the show's largest audience in 14 years with 14 million viewers.[164][165] Senator Obama's appearance occurred in part because Hillary Clinton abandoned her scheduled appearance.[165] The political content was abandoned briefly following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack in New York, with Poehler saying that the writers did not want to produce politicized material; highly political content would be absent for the next 4 years.[165]  Due to the show's live factor, a number of technical problems, performer mishaps, intentional acts of sabotage by performers, protests, and cuts to dead air have occurred throughout the show's run. One incident that garnered widespread media coverage was the October 3, 1992 appearance by singer Sinad O'Connor, in which she ripped up a photo of Pope John Paul II during her performance.[166][167] On April 13, 1996, the alternative metal band Rage Against the Machine made a statement about the host, billionaire Steve Forbes, by hanging two upside-down American flags from their amplifiers. On October 23, 2004, Ashlee Simpson appeared as a musical guest, and there was a lip synching mishap. Her first performance, \"Pieces of Me\", was performed without incident, but when she began her second song, \"Autobiography\", the vocals for \"Pieces of Me\" were heard again through the speakers, even before she had raised the microphone to her mouth. Simpson began to do an impromptu jig, and then left the stage.[168]  Currently, Universal Studios Home Entertainment and Lions Gate Entertainment hold video rights to the series. Universal has issued complete season DVD sets of the first few seasons, while Lionsgate's share of the rights are a result of prior contracts with NBC struck before the NBC Universal merger. A majority of Lionsgate's SNL DVDs are \"Best Of...\" compilations.  Saturday Night Live (ISBN 0-380-01801-2), the first authorized book about the series, was published by Avon Books in 1977 and edited by Anne Beatts and John Head, with photography by Edie Baskin;[169] all three worked for SNL at the time the book was published. The oversized illustrated paperback included the scripts for several sketches by the 19751980 cast.[170] In 1986, Doug Hill and Jeff Weingrad authored Saturday Night: A Backstage History of Saturday Night Live (ISBN 0-688-05099-9), a behind-the-scenes look at the first ten seasons. Saturday Night Live: The First Twenty Years (ISBN 0-395-75284-1), by Michael Cader, was released in 1994, and presented information about the cast, characters, and other memorable moments seen on the show from 1975 to 1994.[171]  Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live, as Told By Its Stars, Writers and Guests (ISBN 0-316-73565-5) was released in 2002. The book, written by Tom Shales and James Andrew Miller, consists of interviews from people who have worked on the show. The interviews reveal personal experiences from what happened backstage and the difficulty of getting the show on air each week.[172] In 2004, former cast member Jay Mohr released his memoir Gasping for Airtime: Two Years in the Trenches of Saturday Night Live (ISBN 1-401-30801-5), about his struggles during his two seasons on the show between 1993 and 1995, dealing with getting sketches on air and the intense work schedule. Cast member Bobby Moynihan described the book as \"a handbook on what NOT to do at SNL.\"[173]  SNL has made several efforts to develop some of the more popular sketches into feature-length films, with varying degrees of commercial and critical success. The first foray into film came with the successful Aykroyd and Belushi vehicle, The Blues Brothers (1980), which earned over $115 million on a $27 million budget.[174]  In 1990, Michaels oversaw the writing of a sketch anthology feature film titled The Saturday Night Live Movie with many of the show's then-current writing staff, including Al Franken, Tom Davis, Greg Daniels, Jim Downey, Conan O'Brien, Robert Smigel, and George Meyer, contributing. The screenplay only got as far as a Revised First Draft dated July 26, 1990 before being abandoned.[175]  However, it was the success of Wayne's World (1992) that encouraged Michaels to produce more film spin-offs, based on several popular sketch characters. Michaels revived 1970s characters for Coneheads (1993), followed by It's Pat (1994); Stuart Saves His Family (1995); A Night at the Roxbury (1998); Superstar (1999) and The Ladies Man (2000). Some did moderately well, though others did notnotably, It's Pat, which did so badly at the box office that the studio that made the film, Touchstone Pictures (owned by The Walt Disney Company, which also owns NBC's rival ABC), pulled it only one week after releasing it,[176] and Stuart Saves His Family, which lost $14 million. Many of these films were produced by Paramount Pictures. The films based on The Blues Brothers were produced by Universal Studios, which merged with NBC in 2004 to form NBC Universal (Universal also has a joint venture with Paramount for international distribution of the two studios' films).  The character Bob Roberts from the Tim Robbins film of the same name (1992), first appeared on SNL in a short film about the conservative folk singer.  In addition, the 1999 comedy film Office Space originated from a series of animated short films by Mike Judge that aired on SNL in 1993.[178]  The fictitious American folk music trio The Folksmen first appeared on SNL, performing the song \"Old Joe's Place\" before later appearing in the film A Mighty Wind (2002). The three members of the Folksmen were the same three comedians: Harry Shearer, Michael McKean, and Christopher Guest, who also appeared on the same episode as the rock group Spinal Tap. At the time of the appearance (the 198485 season), Shearer and Guest were cast members.  Mr. Bill's Real Life Adventures is based off the Mr. Bill sketches from early seasons of SNL.[179][180]  In 2005, the comedy troupe The Lonely Island, consisting of SNL members Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer, and Jorma Taccone, gained national exposure after joining the show and debuting their comedic music video \"Lazy Sunday\", written with fellow cast member Chris Parnell. The song became a surprise hit,[181] and convinced Michaels to encourage the troupe to develop more comedy songs. Further successes with songs including \"Like A Boss, \"Jizz in My Pants\", \"I'm on a Boat\", \"We Like Sportz\", \"Boombox\", and \"Dick in a Box\"which won an Emmy for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics in 2007[182]saw The Lonely Island go on to release two albums, Incredibad (2009)[183] and Turtleneck & Chain (2011), containing SNL-developed songs and original works. The albums were released by Universal Republic Records who were provided with a license to the SNL songs by NBC and Broadway Video.  A cast album was released in 1976 on the Arista label including the song \"Chevy's Girls\" and comedy bits from the show (\"Weekend Update\", \"Emily Litella\", \"Gun Control\"); it was later re-issued on CD and MP3 download.  Several programs have documented the behind-the-scenes events of the show. A 60 Minutes report taped in October 2004 depicted the intense writing frenzy that goes on during the week leading up to a show, with crowded meetings and long hours. The report particularly noted the involvement of the guest host(s) in developing and selecting the sketches in which they will appear. Similarly, there has been an A&E episode of Biography which covered the production process, as well as an episode of TV Tales in 2002 on E!. In 2010, Saturday Night, a 94-minute documentary by actor James Franco in his directorial debut, was released; it follows the production process of the December 6, 2008, episode hosted by John Malkovich, from the concept stage to the episode actually airing live. Although it originated as a five-minute short film for Franco's New York University film class, Michaels granted Franco access to the process, allowing the project to be expanded.[111] On February 15, 2015, NBC aired a 3 1/2 hour special on Saturday Night Live's 40th anniversary. The program included a mix of clips, new performances of classic characters from previous cast members and special guest appearances from previous hosts.[184]  In September 2011, ice cream company Ben & Jerry's released a limited-edition ice cream called \"Schweddy Balls\", inspired by a 1998 sketch of the same name starring Alec Baldwin, Ana Gasteyer and Molly Shannon.[185] The ice cream became the fastest-selling Ben & Jerry's limited-edition flavor. The ice cream was also subject to criticism and boycotts by the One Million Moms organization over the \"vulgar\"[186] name. Some retail chains chose not to sell the flavor, but declined to say if the decision was at their own discretion or based on the One Million Moms boycotts.[186][187] In June 2014, two new flavours inspired by SNL sketches were introducedLazy Sunday, based on a sketch of the same name featuring Andy Samberg and Chris Parnell, and Gilly's Catastrophic Crunch based on the recurring Gilly sketches featuring Kristen Wiig.[188] Two Wild and Crazy Pies, based on the catchphrase of the recurring Festrunk Brothers, was introduced in September 2014,[189] followed by Wayne'Swirled inspired by the eponymous Wayne's World in February 2015.[190]";unknown

In fact, the show recently saw its highest ratings in years thanks to weekly portrayals of President Donald Trump and his administration.  According to Snopes, the fake claim originated on The Last Line of Defense, a website known for posting political satire and fake news. The article claimed that given the shows politically-charged content, it had simply fallen flat. It purported:  After 40 years of successful ratings, springboarding dozens of careers of comedic brilliance to super-stardom, Saturday Night Live has fallen flat. By forgetting that its a comedy variety show and not a leftist propaganda outlet, the shows writers and actors have doomed it to oblivion. NBC released a statement this morning announcing that due to the lowest ratings of all time and the highest number of viewer complaints and general discourse from the American public, this will be the final season of Saturday Night Live: The American people have spoken. Saturday night live, through its divisive skits and hate speech towards our president, has alienated more than 70 percent of its viewers. The ratings are so low that advertisers have refused to continue their relationships with the show and some have threatened to leave NBC altogether.  In reality, Saturday Night Live, which has a long history of mocking presidents, has seen an increase in its ratings thanks to Trump, actor Alec Baldwin and the rest of the Saturday Night Live cast. The Feb. 11 episode, which featured Baldwin as Trump, Kate McKinnon as counselor Kellyanne Conway and Melissa McCarthy as press secretary Sean Spicer, gave the show their highest overnight ratings in six years. According to Entertainment Weekly, the show is on track to have its highest-rated season in 22 years.  Trump has repeatedly criticized Baldwin and Saturday Night Live for their political sketches. According to Time, Trump suggested last year that the show would be canceled, saying, Frankly, the way the show is going now who knows how long that show is going to be on? Its a terrible show. He has previously referred to the show as boring and unfunny, unwatchable and totally biased.  Did you see the fake story about Saturday Night Live getting canceled circulating social media?

White was a victim of a death hoax. The rumor began to spread in Jan. 2017.  At about 11 a.m. ET on Saturday (January 07, 2017), our beloved actress Betty White passed awayShe will be missed but not forgotten. Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page.  This post spread throughout Facebook and other popular social-media sites. Afterward, people started writing R.I.P Betty White posts on the page that started the death hoax and on personal pages to express their sympathy and sadness.  Some of Whites fans believed the hoax at first, while there were some who were not fooled by the news. Doubt built among fans who remembered there were many other death hoaxes about celebrities. People soon realized that there had been no cause of death reported. No reports on any major news site about herdeath were found, which proved the story was fake.  On Jan. 8, Whites representatives shared that she is alive and well. Fans were not happy to hear the hoax. After they had discovered it was fake, people were even more outraged, on the other hand, they were glad to hear that she is well.  White was the subject of a death hoax, as well as many other famous people. The list of celebrities subjected to a death hoaxincludes Sylvester Stallone, Michael Jordan, Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, Jaden Smith, the Queen of England, and Rowan Atkinson; as a result, many fans had a reason to believe that the story was false.  A title of an articlethat was worded an interesting way was taken completely wrongand created the hoax. The headline was explained that White Dyes Peacefully at home reports The Gamers Drop.  The antagonist took the word dyesand changed it turning it into dies creating the rumor.The article was originally about how a limited number of people know that Whites hair is not blonde and that she dyes it in the comfort of her Los Angeles home.  A previous death hoax occurred shortly after the article was originally published. She was once again the subject of false news after the article was relocated.  The Facebook page about Whites death is nothing but a shortcut to the hoax that has gone viral and people want it to be overlooked and not believed.  In 2016, Demetrios Hrysikos, from Spartanburg, South Carolina, started a GoFundMe account for White to help her stay alive through 2017 or protect Betty White, 94, from the grim reaper according to Hrysikos. When the page was first made, his goal was to reach $10,000. The cause went viral and made more than $6,700 in a short period. The donations will be held atSpartanburg Little Theater.  Hrysikos updated the page and posted that he is happy he got as far as he did and was shocked by all the support he got in the project.

Reports that the actress had died started doing the rounds after a satirical tabloid's old article resurfaced online. However, The Golden Girls actress is alive and doing well.  The satirical article titled, \"Actress Betty White, 93, Dyes Peacefully In Her Los Angeles Home\" was initially published in 2014 and has surfaced again. The article talks about Betty dyeing her hair, but the fans clearly misunderstood it.  \"Betty has often told me she feels it is relaxing and soothing to dye her own hair, peacefully in her home, where she can laugh and enjoy time with her animals. She's said on more than one occasion that as a blonde, she has had 'more fun' in her roles, and in life,\" the satirical article quoted her long-time manager as saying.

No, I wont move to New York,' she told Winfrey. I wasted a whole year we could have had together.  White has made similar statements about Ludden in the past. In 2011, when asked by Joy Behar to choose one decision shed happily make again, she replied: Marry Allen Ludden. No two ways about that. He was something special.

model;"Betty White Death";"Betty White Death";"On 3 September 2014, the Empire News web site published a punning article positing that long-time actress and television personality Betty White dyes her hair in the privacy of her home:  In a press release from her long-time manager Jeff Witjas, it has been confirmed today that actress Betty White, best known for her roles on TVs The Mary Tyler Moore Show, The Golden Girls, and Hot in Cleveland, is not a natural blonde. Betty is a solitary kind of person, said Witjas. She likes to relax in her home with her animals, and she rarely likes to discuss the fact, at least in public, that she is actually a brunette. She has been dying her own hair in her home for decades. Betty has often told me she feels it is relaxing and soothing to dye her own hair, peacefully in her home, where she can laugh and enjoy time with her animals. Shes said on more than one occasion that as a blonde, she has had more fun in her roles, and in life.  The punning headline reference to Betty White Dyes Peacefully in Her Los Angeles Home was taken by many readers who didnt read the article itself (and glossed over the die/dye homophone) as a proclamation that White  the subject of many celebrity death hoaxes over the years  had passed away; and soon afterwards links and excerpts referencing this article were being circulated via social media, with many of those who encountered the item mistaking it for a genuine news item.  However, the article was just a spoof from Empire News, one of many fake news sites that publishes outrageous fictional stories such as Cure for Cancer Discovered; Amazingly Simple Says Researcher, College Student Excused from Classes After Dog Eats Grandmother, and Woman Gives Birth, Confuses Doctors by Asking for Maternity Test.  The sites disclaimer page notes that Empire News is a satirical and entertainment website.";hoax
